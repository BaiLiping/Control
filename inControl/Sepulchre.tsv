0	10440	Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.
10440	23440	Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.
23440	27040	I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.
27040	31200	Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Centre of Competence in Research on Dependable Ubiquitous
31200	36360	Automation, as well as the International Federation of Automatic Control.
36360	41360	Our guest today is Rodolf Sapulka, from the University of Cambridge, is Professor of Engineering
41360	43160	in the Control Group.
43160	44840	Welcome to the show, Rodolf.
44840	45840	Thank you.
45840	47840	And good morning, Alberto.
47840	52120	So I should probably give a small disclaimer that I've been spending a lot of time with
52120	54960	Rodolf over three years in Cambridge.
54960	61320	Some time ago in my past, it's been a pleasure to do so and so it will be potentially a semi
61320	66440	different episode in the sense that I know you better than other people.
66440	71440	And so having spent quite some time together, I know you are an avid reader and an avid
71440	72440	hiker.
72440	77880	So I guess just to break the ice, I'm curious about knowing what is on your reading list
77880	78880	at the moment.
78880	79880	Wow.
79880	81880	A very unexpected question.
82800	87880	There are always many things on the reading list.
87880	93960	But actually, there is nothing on the reading list right at the minute, strangely enough.
93960	99680	And often the best novels that I've read, I discovered them by complete accident, for
99680	103040	instance, in the bookstore of an airport.
103040	107360	And so I'm always, I like to be surprised.
107360	111400	And sometimes this leads to the best reads.
111920	112920	I'm curious.
112920	119680	So, OK, one quote, one from one of your favorite readers is Oran Pamuk, a Nobel Prize in Literature
119680	120680	in 2006.
120680	126660	So he said in The New Life, I read a book one day and my whole life was changed.
126660	130720	So if that were to be the book, which one would it be for you?
130720	131720	Which book?
131720	132720	Yes.
132720	133720	That changed my life.
133720	134720	Yeah.
134720	142800	I don't think I could single out one book also because books, yeah, maybe it will be
142800	145000	a strange answer to your question.
145000	152560	But as a teenager, I was totally fascinated by Dostoyevsky.
152560	159200	And then there was a strange event that occurred to me when I was around 40.
159200	164960	And one day I picked a book of Dostoyevsky and I said, let's go back to it.
164960	167680	And I stopped after three pages.
167680	174880	And I realized at that time that the emotion that you can experience while reading a book
174880	182360	is extremely dependent on your age, your environment, your stage in life.
182360	189400	And so I think that it's not that certain books are objectively monuments.
189400	190600	Of course they are.
190600	194860	But I think it's always a story of resonance.
194860	202040	And so it's a resonance at a particular time for a special reason between the reader and
202040	203240	the writer.
203240	206720	That's how I would describe my experience with books.
206720	212960	I actually love this answer because it kind of adds a dynamic element to a book.
212960	217800	It's not something that is there forever, but it really has to be a synergy between
217800	219760	the reader and the book itself.
219760	221080	It's always an encounter.
221080	222080	Yes.
222080	223760	Very fascinating.
223760	229040	So since you mentioned you being a teenager, I like to always draw a sort of picture of
229040	230800	your trajectory as a human.
230800	231800	Yeah.
231800	234360	So I'm curious about what brought you to control.
234360	240120	So like, what is it about, say, your environment or your childhood or anything that you can
240120	243080	think of that brought you to control?
243080	244760	That's very hard to answer.
244760	248240	Again, I don't have a very clear answer.
248240	255360	I can pinpoint events that eventually brought me where I am.
255360	261200	And so one event that perhaps I could tell about what led me to control, even though
261280	267280	it has nothing to do with control, is that it was my second year of engineering.
267280	272600	And it was the course of thermodynamics, which was definitely not my favorite subject at
272600	273600	the time.
273600	280320	But I remember very vividly that the professor once entered the classroom and was nearly
280320	287320	shooting at us and saying, have you heard of what has just been reported that for the
287320	295640	first time ever, one has observed superconductivity above 30 degrees Kelvin.
295640	298760	And that experiments will change the world.
298760	304360	And he went on and for the best part of the lecture, he just told us about these experiments
304360	308280	and why it was fascinating and what would be the consequence of it.
308280	315480	And I don't remember anything of what he told, but I do remember his eyes.
315480	321280	And I do remember the light and I would say the fire during that lecture.
321280	327080	And perhaps it is the moment in my life where I sort of experienced for the first time that
327080	331900	there is such an intimate connection between teaching and research.
331900	338760	And I would say that today I would pinpoint that event as something that led me to my
338760	344840	profession, even though I'm sure that at the time, you know, it was just a complete accident.
344840	348200	Perhaps this professor doesn't remember that he told those stories.
348200	354000	Again, it is a sort of a resonance that is completely accidental.
354000	362200	And I think of any trajectory as somehow interpolating between those events.
362200	366120	And those events are always independent of you.
366120	368120	They are very accidental.
368120	375920	So you could wonder whether how an identity can be defined by such stochastic events.
375920	383080	But at the same time, I like to think that where I am today is not that dependent on
383080	387840	those events and that perhaps a completely different sequence of events would have led
387840	392640	to a trajectory that would not be so different.
392640	394640	And to me, this is a mystery of life.
394640	402120	The fact that we are so much determined by accidental events.
402120	406640	And at the same time, our own identity is not so much in these events, but how we respond
406640	408000	to those events.
408000	415040	And maybe this is my fascination for control theory, because after all, control theory
415040	421040	is a science where you study the interaction between the external and the internal.
421520	425160	We study how systems respond to disturbances.
425160	430440	I find this quite deep and central to engineering, actually.
430440	435160	And decision making is the only lever that you can pull somehow.
435160	437800	I mean, it's definitely fascinating.
437800	442560	I guess the only comment I have is that in a sense, one cannot repeat the experiment
442560	444520	as to the best of our knowledge.
444520	445520	Absolutely.
446000	452280	So we don't know who we would be with another sequence of events.
452280	458720	But this is not something that causes me any anxiety, I would say.
458720	464240	It's also a fact that all these events that I sort of would pinpoint today to define my
464240	470680	trajectory always involve human beings and always involve encounters, those resonance
470680	473160	that I was talking about earlier.
473160	478600	I cannot remember reading a book or reading a text and saying, this is going to change
478600	480360	my life.
480360	487440	But I can pinpoint a sentence that someone told me and that somehow became very important
487440	488440	in my life.
488440	489440	Yeah.
489440	491720	That changed the course of events in a sense.
491720	495960	Well, I mean, I guess one of the things that I really want to mention is that, you know,
495960	500840	by interacting with you over the years, one of the things I learned from you is an appreciation
500840	503360	for the history of a problem.
503360	509360	And so I found a very nice quote from Kepler from the Astronomia Nova.
509360	515120	So he says, the roads by which men arrive at their insights into celestial matters seem
515120	519680	to me almost as worthy of wonder as those matters themselves.
519680	523880	So today I would like to try and draw, you know, your trajectory.
523880	529480	You started from at least academically speaking from a paper with your PhD advisor, stability
529520	533800	for dynamical systems with first integrals, a topological criteria.
533800	538280	So something very mathematical and very much rooted in nonlinear control.
538280	543040	And today I would say that your manifesto that we will talk about certainly in a second
543040	547220	is towards building spiking control systems.
547220	551000	So how do we connect these two points?
551000	552600	What happened in the middle?
552600	558880	Yeah, again, it's a very strange sequence of events and the events don't really explain
558880	561320	the outcome.
561320	567880	But I think that control theory requires a lot of mathematical abstraction.
567880	575920	And at the same time, I think that control theory to me is really engineering driven.
575920	583240	So the important contributions of control have always come from very concrete engineering
583240	584880	questions.
584880	590480	And it is this meeting point between the abstraction and the concreteness of the questions that
590480	595420	attracts me and that I think has always attracted me in control.
595420	598360	So my engineering education was quite mathematical.
598360	606660	In fact, my specialty was mathematical engineering, if such a thing exists.
606660	612960	So definitely I had a taste for mathematics, as I think many people in control have.
613040	620920	But over the years, I became more and more sympathetic to the concreteness of control.
620920	627440	And this is also what I like about the basic control courses, is that it's hard, I think,
627440	635920	to pinpoint other courses early in the curriculum, where there is such a bridge made between,
635920	641800	you know, the very concrete questions of making the speed of a motor insensitive to
641800	645960	load and complex analysis.
645960	648520	How comes that those things connect to each other?
648520	654160	How comes that a little bit of abstraction is so powerful in providing such concrete
654160	658040	answer that I find fascinating in control?
658040	659440	I totally agree.
659440	665440	And probably I wouldn't even have started this podcast if I weren't so fascinated.
665440	669840	I guess here we are almost at a crossing point in the sense that we can either follow
669840	675800	the chronological course of events and, you know, follow your trajectory starting from
675800	681920	deep theoretical questions in nonlinear control or start in a bit of an unusual way right
681920	682920	from the present.
682920	684600	So what keeps you busy these days?
684600	687640	And I would probably ask you, actually, what do you prefer?
687640	690120	I have no preference.
690120	693040	Of course, it's always easier to speak about the presence.
693480	697360	That's what, you know, keeps me awake.
697360	698920	So let's speak about the present.
698920	702800	I think the present is a very exciting thing to talk about.
702800	708360	At least I was reading the other day your paper on the IEEE proceedings, Spiking Control
708360	714440	Systems, to me that is really a manifesto almost towards what are you going to do over
714440	717640	the probably the next decade, I believe.
717880	724120	I really liked one quote where you say explicitly, we aim at developing a control theory of spiking
724120	729720	systems which will apply both to the natural world of biophysical neural circuits and the
729720	732320	post digital technology of event based systems.
732320	735080	I think that sentence is a masterpiece.
735080	742280	And it somehow is transparent that you also want to inherit all the heritage from cybernetics.
742320	747480	But moving forward, you want to incorporate new knowledge, let's say, coming from control
747480	752280	systems and the mixed feedback principle that we will definitely talk about in a second.
752280	756480	So what is your goal and your motivation, I would say, as well?
756480	766480	Yeah, my motivation is very clearly to focus on the importance of event based systems and
766480	769040	event based control.
769040	774960	As a topic that has received, I would consider very, very little attention in control.
774960	783360	The name I think was quote uncoined by Karl Astrum and his book chapter of 2007 that is
783360	785940	called event based control.
785940	791600	My reading of that book chapter is that itself it builds upon a paper that Karl Astrum wrote
791600	797520	in 1991, together with Carl Vermeet, the father of neuromorphic engineering.
797520	801280	And that brings the importance of events.
801280	808360	And it's very, very defeating to talk about events and to do research about events nowadays,
808360	813840	because our language and the language of information engineering has become so divided between
813840	818560	the analog language on the one hand and digital language on the other hand.
818560	826760	And events are clearly something that mixed the continuous and the digital.
827000	834040	And as a control theorist, I've come to regard this story as a story of mixed feedback, the
834040	841520	positive feedback being associated to discrete states and by stability and automata and the
841520	848320	language of digital technology, and negative feedback being associated with homeostasis,
848320	853920	regulation, and the theory of continuous regulation.
854080	859760	It is only through time and because I was studying neuroscience and because I started
859760	864880	reading what I was seeing in neuroscience as a theory of mixed feedback that I became
864880	870360	aware that in fact cybernetics was a science of mixed feedback.
870360	874400	And I think many people in the community would agree that the cybernetics age was a sort
874400	878800	of a golden age, very short lived golden age of control.
878800	883440	And that nowadays there are many signs that we are sort of returning to that age.
883440	889400	But much better equipped, because in the meantime, we have developed fantastic tools
889400	897400	that we can now use to reconsider questions that perhaps were ahead of their time.
897400	906480	But definitely my view is that the digital age created this strong separation between
906480	911880	positive feedback and negative feedback and that control theory became a theory of negative
911880	918600	feedback and that it is a little bit today the trap where control theory or the corner
918600	925800	where control theory is sitting, and that there is so much more to explore and to be
925800	932960	connected both to biology, but also to now these fast developing event-based sensors
932960	939720	and event-based actuators that is opening so many new questions and new path of research
939760	945120	for control theories that I find is very, very exciting.
945120	947920	There's a lot to unpack in what you just said.
947920	951200	I just want to maybe mention a couple of things for our audience.
951200	956280	And then I guess we will delve into some of the concepts that you mentioned so far.
956280	959400	So first of all, I just want to mention to the audience of control theory, let's say
959400	961880	that who Carver Mead is.
961880	966800	Carver Mead worked with John Hopfield and Richard Feynman, novelist, helping to create
967040	971920	three new fields, neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and the physics of computation.
971920	977920	Just to name a few, he founded at least 20 companies from integrated circuits to silicon
977920	980360	sensors for photographic imaging.
980360	985000	So he was really a pioneering figure in the history of science.
985000	991160	But since you were mentioning, first of all, the notion of mixed feedback or the mixed
991160	993840	feedback principle, maybe we should try to unpack that.
993880	1000400	So what does that imply or how can we explain, let's say, to our audience, what is the mixed
1000400	1002480	feedback principle?
1002480	1008760	So the mixed feedback terminology comes from the mixed feedback amplifier that features
1008760	1017240	the cover of the well-known textbooks of electrical circuits by Desueur and Shua from the 80s.
1017320	1023880	And on the cover of the textbooks, you see the op-amp with a wire both connected to the
1023880	1028880	negative part of the, so a feedback wire, a wire connecting the output of the amplifier
1028880	1034360	both to the negative part of the amplifier and to the positive part of the amplifier.
1034360	1039720	And the story of the feedback amplifier that we know in control theory, that I knew in
1039720	1043400	control theory, was the story of negative feedback.
1043440	1047800	Historically, things went the other way around.
1047800	1054720	The first use of the op-amp was the positive feedback amplifier, because that was the way
1054720	1058360	to design switches in analog systems.
1058360	1065400	And so until the Second World War, the only way to realize switching circuits and circuits
1065400	1072000	that were not equilibrium circuits was through positive feedback amplifiers.
1072040	1078400	And this makes the discovery of Black, of the negative feedback amplifier, only more
1078400	1085600	impressive that he had this vision that there could be a use of connecting the output of
1085600	1091600	the op-amp to the negative part, because that would make the op-amp less sensitive to
1091600	1094760	disturbance, less sensitive to uncertainty.
1094760	1101680	And so we know that it took, I think, nine years for Black to get his discovery patented.
1101760	1107480	And so that shows the spirit of the time, that why would you ever connect the output
1107480	1110440	of a system to the negative part?
1110440	1115080	And today we have just the opposite view, at least as a student.
1115080	1119920	And I remember speaking to some control theorists and talking to them about positive feedback
1119920	1128160	and seeing that face, that why would you ever connect the output of an op-amp to the positive part?
1128160	1135200	And then the way I read any device in the body, and in particular in the brain, is a
1135200	1137360	mixed feedback amplifier.
1137360	1145000	And so nature somehow is making use of this mixed feedback amplification all the time.
1145000	1148720	And I think for very good reasons.
1148720	1153120	So yeah, this is my short story of the mixed feedback concept.
1153120	1157280	Maybe like just to help the audience grasp what it really means.
1157280	1162880	So I guess what you're advocating is that in a feedback loop, there's always, if we're
1162880	1168760	interested, let's say, in building systems that range, let's say, from the analog behavior
1168760	1174480	to the digital behavior, we should mix, really have elements that both have positive feedback
1174480	1179720	and negative feedback in order to be able to capture, let's say, almost all behaviors
1179720	1180720	of interest.
1180720	1182720	Is that fair to say?
1182720	1191160	But at least in my view, to sort of reunite the two branches of control that are automation
1191160	1193720	and regulation.
1193720	1199440	So today, you know, the conferences are different, the classes are different, the textbooks are
1199440	1201920	different, and you choose your side.
1201920	1209680	Either you study automation through automata to the language of discrete states, finite
1209680	1216000	state machines, or you study continuous control systems, and the world of regulation and the
1216000	1220080	world of which is fundamentally an analog world.
1220080	1227360	And I think that the best of those two worlds comes together when you consider mixed feedback.
1227360	1232760	Something that was sort of, I think, very well appreciated in the 40s, the time where
1232760	1239240	of the golden age of the mixed feedback amplifier, but then somehow disappeared from the field.
1240000	1246080	I guess this is a good point where to mention how does the mixed feedback principle enter
1246080	1248240	into the picture of neuroscience?
1248240	1255560	So I guess we could mention some of the paradigmatic models of how a single neuron behaves.
1255560	1256560	That's probably a good example.
1256560	1263920	Well, of course, the fundamental model of neuronal excitability that goes back to Hodgkin
1263920	1271600	and Huxley in 1952, is precisely the model of explaining the action potential of a neuron,
1271600	1278480	so the spike, as through the analogy of an electrical circuit, where you attach to an
1278480	1284680	RC circuit, so a passive circuit, you attach two current sources, one providing positive
1284680	1287880	feedback and the other one providing negative feedback.
1287880	1294240	And identifying those two current sources was the fundamental insight of Hodgkin and
1294240	1299080	Huxley and is the mechanism of thresholds.
1299080	1307200	And so what we, I think, the fundamental elements that we now see appearing in technology is
1307200	1309400	the value of thresholds.
1309400	1316120	And so as long as you use negative feedback, as long as you only consider negative feedback
1316360	1321800	control, you are in the world of equilibrium systems, so you always reject disturbance
1321800	1324760	and try to go back to equilibrium.
1324760	1329620	The world of mixed feedback introduced this notion of threshold, that if the disturbance
1329620	1335840	exceeds a certain level, you want to signal the disturbance and you signal through an
1335840	1342240	event and that event is a spike and that event can be transmitted, can be communicated, there
1342240	1344680	is something happening.
1344680	1350480	I find this extremely important in every behavior and of course we could take the example
1350480	1358240	of robotics, but in fact any single control system that you look at is just jumping from
1358240	1360440	event to event.
1360440	1366820	And again, that goes back very much to the early view of cybernetics and I like the one
1366820	1373940	of Ross Ashby in particular, who developed this concept of ultra-stability, thinking
1373940	1382260	of machines as systems that switch between discrete states, like an automaton, however
1382260	1386660	each of these states being continuously regulated.
1386660	1393780	And so it is sort of a mixture between an automaton and it's a regulated automaton.
1393780	1399980	It is a concept that is very, very clear and present in the early days of cybernetics,
1399980	1405420	but there was no theory at the time to formulate that concept.
1405420	1409780	And I think that, so that has been at the core of my research to try to now use the
1409780	1419980	current theory of control to formulate what would be and how should we model such a machine.
1419980	1425940	Since you mentioned the notion of, you know, dynamics away from equilibrium, this is just
1425940	1426940	a personal curiosity.
1426940	1433820	Have you ever thought about like the links between what you're studying today and thermodynamics?
1433820	1436220	So something that you didn't like so much.
1436220	1440780	So it seems like at least locally, you're going against the principles of thermodynamics,
1440780	1446940	you're generating order in a way, I don't know if I'm making sense.
1446940	1454820	I think that thermodynamics away from equilibrium, as it was developed in the 80s and very popular
1454820	1464900	in the 90s, is indeed very much the analog of the way, you know, chemical reactions and
1464900	1468820	which at the end, those neurons are made of.
1468820	1475580	So how can chemical reactions away from equilibrium generate order, generate patterns, generate...
1475580	1483340	So at sort of a high conceptual level, yes, there is clearly a lot of resonance between
1483340	1489980	the idea of thermodynamics out of equilibrium and the idea of control out of equilibrium.
1489980	1496140	But of course, and I'm not an expert of thermodynamics, but when I discuss thermodynamics out of equilibrium
1496140	1502300	with experts, I hear that we are very far away from having a proper theory of thermodynamics
1502300	1503300	away from equilibrium.
1503860	1506420	It's probably too early to talk about these questions.
1506420	1510580	Somebody who will listen to this podcast in the future, 50 years away from now, will have
1510580	1512380	some answers, hopefully.
1512380	1517820	Since you mentioned event-based systems, and I guess one of the main applications you have
1517820	1522300	in mind are potentially event-based cameras, I think maybe we can dig into that.
1522300	1527180	So I guess those are the applications you have in mind, probably.
1527180	1528180	Is that fair to say?
1528180	1530340	Or is that more a twist?
1530380	1537460	Well, I think that when I talk about mixed feedback, people often talk about my interest
1537460	1538460	in neuroscience.
1538460	1543140	And indeed, it is because of my interest in neuroscience that I became interested in mixed
1543140	1549820	feedback and that I became sort of obsessed to try to reconcile theory, control theory
1549820	1552740	with the mixed feedback principle.
1552740	1558980	But in the recent years, and since I sort of discovered this whole community of neuromorphic
1558980	1565740	engineering and event-based sensing, it occurred to me that in fact, even away from neuroscience,
1565740	1571420	there is a huge potential of exploring event-based control.
1571420	1576220	And for instance, if you look at the book chapter of Karl Armstrong on event-based control,
1576220	1581940	his motivation comes from all possible applications of control, but neuroscience.
1581940	1589860	So it's also a way for me to sort of go back in my home country, which is the theory of
1589860	1595340	control systems, and to think away from neuroscience of the potential use of mixed feedback or
1595340	1598700	the potential use of thresholds.
1598700	1606540	And clearly, we now see an explosion of event-based sensors and event-based actuators.
1606540	1612500	So sooner or later, control engineers will be called to connect them together.
1612500	1617300	And I think it's fair to say that at the moment, we don't have a theory to connect an event-based
1617300	1620540	sensors to an event-based actuator.
1620540	1625660	The way we do it at the moment is that we interface the event-based sensors with a digital
1625660	1627500	processor.
1627500	1633400	And then we interface the output of the digital processor, maybe to an event-based actuator.
1633400	1635020	And that's how we close the loop.
1635020	1641220	But of course, it's very tempting to think that in some specific cases, we could short
1641220	1647500	circuit this interface and go straight from the event-based sensors to the event-based
1647500	1648500	actuator.
1648500	1651780	It makes a lot of sense.
1651780	1657740	Also, I guess, very trivially, potentially, just for energetic considerations.
1657740	1663540	So all of the systems that you're mentioning are very much energy, what's the opposite
1663540	1664540	of energy-hungry?
1664540	1668700	They would be not very consuming in terms of energy.
1668700	1669700	Yeah.
1669700	1677180	So this is one advantage that is very often put forward, especially nowadays in the energy
1677180	1684500	crisis that we experience, that event-based is also a potential solution to the carbon
1684500	1689920	footprint of current technology, and in particular, digital technology.
1689920	1696560	When I was a student, it was the beginning of the internet, and we really presented digital
1696560	1703280	technology and digital information as a free technology, as an energy-free technology.
1703280	1710760	And it's funny that 30 years later, especially after this pandemic, suddenly the carbon footprint
1710760	1713640	of digital technology is making news.
1713640	1722460	And everyone is sort of becoming very worried about the growing energy demand of the storing,
1722460	1728400	but not just storage, but all the devices that come with information technology.
1728400	1731360	And I think that that's exactly the vision of Kaveh Mead.
1731360	1737280	And Kaveh Mead saw that at the end of the 80s, so long ahead of his time, perhaps because
1737280	1743640	he was at the very forefront of digital technology, and he could foresee that this Moore's law
1743640	1750120	that he formulated himself would not go forever, and that there would be a time where we would
1750120	1755800	be hit by the limitation of digital technology, including the, and prime and foremost, the
1755800	1758840	energy demand of digital technology.
1758840	1761640	And I think we are living exactly in that time.
1761640	1765080	This is a good segue for me to talk about energy.
1765080	1768360	Energy from a control theoretic perspective.
1768360	1776040	So very much part of your theoretical investigations is the concept of dissipativity.
1776040	1778920	And that's one of the pillars of systems theory.
1778920	1783920	So maybe you can guide us through how does that interwine with the mixed feedback principle,
1783920	1789720	neuroscience, and your current obsession about monotonicity.
1789720	1793200	Don't get me started, because it would become a seminar.
1793200	1801760	But yeah, it's true that I think that dissipativity is a central concept of control theory, for
1801760	1806720	many reasons, but prime and foremost, because it describes this interaction between the
1806720	1813000	external and internal that I was mentioning earlier, in energetic terms.
1813000	1820280	So how does the external supply of energy relates to the internal storage of energy?
1820280	1826840	I think it's a very profound way of describing how a system or how physical systems interacts
1826840	1829320	with its environment.
1829320	1832520	It's not the only reason why dissipativity is so important.
1832520	1838000	I think that, so dissipativity is a bridge, but it's not just a bridge between the external
1838000	1839000	and the internal.
1839000	1845000	It's also a bridge between mechanics and electricity, because it's also a bridge between
1845000	1851440	the input-output description of systems and the state-space description of a system.
1851440	1857640	So it is also a bridge between the heritage of electricity, where we think of circuits
1857640	1864000	as interconnection of input-output devices, and the heritage of mechanics, where we think
1864000	1870480	of systems as determined by, let's say, Newton's law and governing the motion from an initial
1870480	1872960	condition.
1872960	1879440	Dissipativity really interconnects those two worlds, generalizing the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov
1879440	1885520	lemma, which is perhaps the fundamental heritage of our field.
1885520	1892560	And this bridge is not just a bridge between physics and analysis, between input-output
1892560	1893560	and state-space.
1893560	1901040	It is also a bridge between physics and computation, because it is also through that bridge that
1901040	1905180	linear control theory became algorithmic.
1905180	1913400	It is fascinating that in the dissipativity paper of Ian Williams, the LMI is almost mentioned
1913400	1921280	there en passant, but in fact precedes by 20 years the reformulation of control theory
1921600	1928640	of every important control theoretic question as the solution of context optimization problem.
1928640	1933360	So yes, dissipativity is important in many ways.
1933360	1939440	And then when I moved to mixed feedback, when I moved to neuroscience, I was very frustrated
1939440	1946600	that somehow I could not use this theory, or I was always hoping for.
1946600	1954160	And I think here, perhaps I have to mention how I came to connect mixed feedback to dissipativity.
1954160	1960280	And this is thanks to a question from Malcolm Smith, my close colleague.
1960280	1967560	I had given my TED talk in 2014 about mixed feedback and, you know, praising the use of
1967560	1969160	mixed feedback.
1969160	1974520	And then I had this conversation with Malcolm and Malcolm said, by the way, how do you define
1974520	1976520	negative feedback?
1976520	1988400	Yeah, you have to, I mean, the value of such questions is, I think that most of my research
1988400	1995080	comes from such questions that are sometimes asked by colleagues, most of the times asked
1995080	1997860	by my students, by my postdocs.
1997860	2002000	It's really through those conversations that you realize that something that you found
2002000	2005460	evident and self-explanatory, in fact, is not.
2005460	2010440	And that is pushing you further into digging into the question.
2010440	2012160	So how do you define?
2012160	2018280	And the point of Malcolm was that defining what negative feedback is, is what led to
2018280	2020020	control theory.
2020020	2026120	Because after the invention of the feedback amplifier, very quickly, people start experiencing
2026120	2028240	instability with negative feedback.
2028240	2031280	How could possibly negative feedback lead to instability?
2031560	2036880	Aha, well, this is because the dynamics of the plan can, in fact, change the sign of
2036880	2041080	the feedback in the loop because of the phase shift.
2041080	2044720	And this leads to the frequency response and Nyquist.
2044720	2049880	So the whole heritage of control is in that question somehow.
2049880	2055740	Now through the question of Malcolm, I realized that there was something missing in connecting
2055980	2062860	mixed feedback to, let's say, dissipativity, because the only way you can define the sign
2062860	2069620	of a feedback loop in a nonlinear system is by thinking incrementally.
2069620	2075260	So if the feedback signal is a current signal, what determines the sign of the feedback loop
2075260	2079860	is not whether the current is an inward or outward current.
2079860	2085940	It is whether the current source has positive conductance or negative conductance.
2085940	2093820	That distinction between the sign of a current and the incremental sign of a current is something
2093820	2100900	that I didn't appreciate until I started working in that area, until I started discovering
2100900	2108540	how much it is a source of confusion in neuroscience and how much it is a source of confusion in
2108540	2110780	control.
2110780	2118260	That we, because of the heritage of the linear theory, we always tend to think of incremental
2118260	2123460	quantities and non-incremental quantities as equivalents, but they are only equivalent
2123460	2126140	for linear systems.
2126140	2133000	And this is how I started realizing that all what I knew in nonlinear control was rooted
2133000	2139280	in a non-incremental approach, including dissipativity.
2139280	2146760	So the dissipativity, the definition of dissipativity of Williams is nonlinear, but it is non-incremental.
2146760	2155000	That is, solutions are always evaluated with respect to the zero storage, the equilibrium
2155000	2159120	solution that corresponds to the minimal storage.
2159120	2165600	Instead of evaluating solutions with respect to each other.
2165600	2171640	And that has indeed become a sort of an obsession to realize that we didn't have an incremental
2171640	2174880	form of dissipativity theory.
2174880	2181480	And for many years I tried, and I don't think I'm the only one who tried to explain and
2181480	2189160	understand why we didn't have an incremental form of dissipativity, until I sort of came
2189160	2193920	up to the conclusion that in fact, we don't have a theory of incremental dissipativity
2193920	2201720	because we don't have, it's very, very difficult to think of states-based models that have
2201720	2205560	incremental input-output properties.
2205560	2208280	That gap is a total surprise to me.
2208280	2213280	It is very much, it's very close to my current research question.
2213280	2217600	And again, it is something that independently from neuroscience, independently from the
2217600	2223240	particular application that led to those questions, I think is a question, is an important question
2223240	2228720	for the field is how do you define a nonlinear capacitor?
2228720	2234880	And I've come to the conclusion that the classical state-space definition of a nonlinear capacitor
2235200	2244160	that's, for instance, was advocated by Shua and that is rarely questioned, in fact is
2244160	2252000	problematic because it gives us a model of a nonlinear integrator that is not incrementally
2252000	2254440	passive.
2254440	2264080	And this whole path from dissipativity to mixed feedback and sort of back to dissipativity
2264080	2273080	is to me, an example of how research sort of evolves and how ultimately the only way
2273080	2282280	to formulate new questions that can be extremely theoretical and fundamental is always in control
2282280	2284840	driven by very concrete questions.
2284840	2293800	So I would never have imagined to question the state-space model of a nonlinear capacitor
2293800	2300040	unless I had been pushed to refine what I meant by positive and negative feedback and
2300040	2306560	how I can sort of encapsulate these concepts that are clear to everyone because they are
2306560	2311880	everyday concepts, but if you want to turn them into a mathematical theory, you have
2311880	2318480	to work hard and then you eventually discover that the theory is incomplete.
2318520	2323680	I think this is the path of research in many problems in control theory.
2325560	2327680	Again, there is a lot to unpack there.
2328680	2331960	It was a fantastic journey just to follow your line of thought.
2332800	2338320	Maybe, OK, the first comment that I have is very curious that at the end of the day, we end up
2338320	2346280	talking so much about a sign change in a sense or whether it's positive feedback or negative
2346280	2353000	feedback. Another thing that I can extrapolate from line of thought is that, well, I'm going
2353000	2356560	to quote Sherlock Holmes from Scandal in Bohemia.
2356600	2362760	He says that it is a capital mistake to theorize that before one has data, insensibly one
2362760	2367000	begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts.
2367000	2370080	And this is very much resonating with what you said.
2370440	2375480	So it seems to me also that, yeah, we are in a situation in control theory at the moment
2375480	2381680	where we very much see what Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions predicted.
2381680	2388880	So there are phases in science where there is a growing miscontent with theories that in
2388880	2394000	some way do not satisfy, they're not able to answer questions that we do have.
2394680	2400960	And yeah, the last comment I have is that it's quite funny that we always end up talking,
2401360	2407560	at least in the background, there is always the figure of Jan Willems kind of foreseeing the
2407560	2413360	importance of so many of these questions, including dissipativity and the tension between
2413360	2414720	paradigms and puzzles.
2415120	2417240	So, yeah, that's very true.
2417680	2422080	And there is a lot in what you just said in a few words.
2422480	2426840	I agree. And I think that it's not special to our fields.
2426840	2432120	In fact, perhaps this is the value of venturing in neighboring fields.
2432360	2437240	So, for instance, I worked for maybe 10 years in optimization and manifolds and was really a
2437240	2442240	journey outside of my field, I would say, had not much to do with control.
2442840	2446960	Then I ventured in neuroscience, in neurodynamics, again, in another neighboring
2446960	2452480	community. And in all those communities, I always observed what you just described.
2453160	2458680	I think it's inevitable that a topic becomes a topic because it becomes popular.
2459320	2467880	And even if initially it emerged from a very concrete question, maybe after one generation,
2468720	2476160	it becomes a theory that is somehow independent from the question that led to the theory.
2476920	2479520	And the next generation just works on the theory.
2480080	2483320	And there is nothing wrong about that because you want to deepen the theory.
2484480	2490800	The only problem is that this by deepening the theory, you know, you create more expertise
2490800	2496440	and you create theory that is more and more detached from the original question that
2496440	2497640	motivated the theory.
2498560	2505040	And inevitably, eventually, this theory sort of detaches itself from reality.
2505040	2512040	And and at that time, I think there is indeed the danger that it becomes sort of self
2512040	2517200	referencing. But as soon as something becomes self referencing, it dies very quickly.
2517840	2524400	So I think I feel much more in peace with that phenomenon nowadays because I think there
2524400	2526200	is nothing wrong in that phenomenon.
2526200	2532680	Perhaps initially I thought, oh, but my field is bad because people are going that way.
2533200	2536720	I don't think it is specific to my field.
2536760	2540280	I think it is specific to the mechanism of research.
2540880	2545480	It just shows the importance of diversity in science.
2545720	2552200	I think of all my journeys in neighboring disciplines as sort of going into a foreign
2552200	2554520	country for a while and then going back home.
2555240	2559920	And to me, it has always been important to come back home because this is where I feel
2559920	2562840	home. And I think it's important to have a home.
2563320	2569160	But it's also by traveling that you realize, first of all, that you realize the value of
2569160	2570600	your own identity.
2571080	2577000	And nowadays, I think I have much higher appreciation for the value of control than I had
2577000	2578960	before venturing in other fields.
2579880	2585320	But it also makes you aware of the importance of diversity because it's only by, you
2585320	2590760	know, venturing and by traveling that you encounter new questions that you and this is
2590760	2593200	very refreshing. This is very important.
2593200	2598160	So there is indeed a tension, I think, and we have to be very careful about that tension.
2598480	2600240	There is no easy answer.
2600280	2605200	Otherwise, it's part of the cycle of of life in a sense.
2606160	2610560	Yeah, I mean, it seems almost an evolutionary process in a sense.
2610560	2613880	So theories do tend, as you say, to evolve on their own.
2613880	2616680	But at the same time, if they do that too much, they die.
2617120	2621280	Yeah, I think it's super interesting, potentially like the topic of another podcast
2621720	2627560	episode. I just want to close the loop maybe on on the, let's say, nonlinear control side of
2627560	2633120	things, because we didn't touch on, at least in depth, on some of the concepts that I think
2633120	2639160	are key and also made you win, for example, an Axelby Prize recently on the concept of
2639160	2645440	dissipativity. And maybe they're so and we're talking about the concept of P-dominance
2645440	2647600	for those who are not familiar with it.
2647600	2653000	There will be a link in the description and, you know, the concept of contraction, the
2653000	2656360	concept of positivity and the concept of monotonicity.
2656640	2663280	So how do all of these notions interwine and why are they so fundamental in a way?
2664160	2671640	OK, again, there is danger that I start a seminar here, but at the core of all these
2671640	2676640	questions is, again, the difference between incremental and non-incremental.
2677000	2685280	And I think it's best to start with the concept that is perhaps the most common concept to
2685480	2690720	every control theory, the concept of stability, and even more so the concept of Lyapunov
2690720	2695640	stability, which is a concept of internal stability, so state-space concept.
2696880	2702760	Lyapunov stability is non-incremental, it is stability with respect to an equilibrium
2702760	2708640	solution. The non-incremental, the incremental form of Lyapunov stability is
2708960	2718320	contraction. And contraction was introduced in our field in 98, this paper of Slotin and
2718360	2726000	Lou Miller, that I think is a turning point in our appreciation of incremental properties
2726560	2728280	in the state-space domain.
2729040	2737520	And we see nowadays, 15 years, 25 years after this, the publication of this paper, that
2737520	2740480	indeed contraction has become widely appreciated.
2740800	2749120	And I think that there is a wide appreciation of why contraction is important and perhaps
2750040	2754120	more important in many engineering questions than Lyapunov stability.
2754520	2759680	But contraction is just an incremental form, in my thinking, is just an incremental form of
2759680	2760680	Lyapunov stability.
2761440	2767800	Now, this is all about an internal concept of stability or a state-space concept.
2768720	2771480	What about the input-output concepts?
2771800	2776840	Input-output stability is well understood in the linear case.
2777440	2781880	In the non-linear case, the incremental form of input-output stability is an incremental
2781880	2787920	gain. And there is some theory about incremental L2 gains.
2788480	2795800	But a big missing bit of the control theory today is the lack of concept of incremental
2795880	2801320	passivity. That brings us back to the question I was alluding to earlier.
2801560	2805080	Why don't we have an incremental form of dissipativity?
2806160	2811280	And so the notion of incremental passivity is very well understood in an input-output
2811280	2817440	setting. If you go back to the early work of the textbooks of de Zuhr and Vidya Sagar, for
2817440	2824080	instance, passivity and incremental passivity are treated on equal foot, I would say.
2824680	2830440	But in my education, which is post-input-output theory, which is very much state-space
2830440	2837880	theory, because from the 80s, non-linear control became dominated by state-space
2838440	2839760	modelling approaches.
2840440	2845120	The incremental concept is pretty much absent of any textbooks of non-linear control.
2845520	2850160	So non-linear control theory is very much a non-incremental theory nowadays.
2850920	2854120	And I think it's because of the state-space model concept.
2854160	2861000	So my effort in revisiting incremental passivity, and that is what led me to this notion
2861000	2863800	of monotonicity. What is monotonicity?
2863840	2865840	It's incremental positivity.
2866400	2869800	So we have what are the notions of positivity?
2869800	2875080	Or we have many notions of positivity, because when we go from scalar to vectors and then
2875280	2881160	we go from vectors to operators, well, there are many ways to generalise the concept of
2881160	2886120	positivity. Passivity is one concept of positivity out of many.
2887640	2894200	And monotonicity as the incremental form of passivity is one concept of monotonicity
2894200	2895240	among others.
2895560	2902200	It's an input-output concept of monotonicity that I've discovered by going back to the
2902200	2908040	early days of circuit theory and by discovering that the person who invented the concept of
2908040	2916320	monotonicity, Minty in 1960, was precisely trying to answer a question that I've had to
2916320	2917560	answer for the last 10 years.
2917800	2919320	What is a non-linear resistor?
2919520	2923400	How do you define an element with positive conductance?
2923800	2930360	Here we go. That's also the value of re-studying history from time to time is that very,
2930360	2933920	very often you discover the answer to your questions.
2934160	2938560	You discover that they have been previously answered, but then they have been forgotten.
2939440	2945120	And so I became very interested in the input-output concept of monotonicity invented by
2945120	2950400	Minty, the fact that it then became a sort of foundation of convex optimisation.
2950400	2957600	So again, this bridge between physical modelling and computation is very much there and it
2957600	2960520	is there in the incremental form of passivity.
2960880	2967080	It is not there in the non-incremental form of passivity, which was the topic of my first
2967080	2976080	book, so of my early days in control, using passivity as a fundamental concept to, let's
2976080	2978320	say, solve stabilisation questions.
2979280	2985760	But the non-linear passivity concept, the non-incremental form of passivity, is a very
2985960	2991800	nice concept, of course, because it retains a physical meaning, but it's not an algorithmic
2991800	2993200	concept for sure.
2994440	3001360	And so the fact that a negative conductance, so a resistance with negative conductance
3001360	3010440	could be a passive element, started really showing the value of clarifying the incremental
3010440	3016120	properties of a device and not just the non-incremental passivity property of a device.
3016960	3021520	Sorry if it is too long of an answer to your question, but it's never too long, never.
3022800	3028040	I guess when you refer to conductance, you mean differential conductance or incremental
3028040	3030800	conductance. That's what you conceptually visualise.
3030840	3034800	Because I think that conductance should be understood only differentially.
3035440	3040480	The notion of chordal conductance or non-incremental conductance is not really
3040480	3046000	meaningful. Monotonicity means that the slope of your function is always positive.
3046680	3052120	But what is the meaning of positivity with respect to zero, that the graph of your function
3052120	3054160	lies in the first and third quadrants?
3055360	3061040	Yes, it is a property, but it's a property that has nothing to do with monotonicity.
3061640	3068000	And I think one would agree that for most problems, the property of monotonicity would be
3068000	3073600	far more important than the property of positivity, of non-incremental positivity.
3074280	3080480	I hear a lot of, let's say, resonance with one of your latest editorials on the IEEE
3080480	3082120	controlled magazines systems.
3082160	3085640	I should mention that Rodolf is the editor-in-chief of that journal.
3085640	3089560	I'll put a link in the description to the journal and the editorials.
3090520	3093960	The last one at this stage is about the art of the state.
3094400	3102600	And it's really a campaign to almost overthrow the state space modelling in favour of
3102600	3108520	something that is more tractable and something that is also, I would say, more robust for
3108520	3110800	the purpose of algorithmic computation.
3110800	3112320	Is that fair to say, you think?
3113440	3119520	I'm always sorry when I hear that I'm campaigning against something because it is
3119520	3123600	certainly not my intention to campaign against state space modelling.
3124040	3131680	To me, the value of control is precisely in bridging the state space world of mechanics
3131680	3135280	and the input-output world of electricity.
3136520	3139040	So my campaign is for that bridge.
3139840	3142120	It's not that we should be one-sided.
3142520	3147640	And it is for that bridge because my view of control theory or for non-linear control
3147640	3151400	theory is that today that it's very much dominated by state space, so it's very much
3151400	3152400	one-sided.
3153280	3159920	And it's not an accident that every application of non-linear control nowadays is in,
3160680	3167360	well, I should say nearly, almost application is in robotics rather than in electronics.
3167880	3173960	In fact, the contact between control and circuits disappeared in the non-linear age.
3174600	3179600	So if you open a textbook on non-linear control, there is very, very little about non-linear
3179600	3185080	circuits. And if you open a textbook about non-linear circuits, there is very, very little
3185080	3194120	about control. And my efforts to model neural systems as non-linear circuits has pushed
3194120	3201680	me to study and learn the old theory that was developed in the 70s that was all coming
3201680	3208880	from circuit theory and aiming at developing a non-linear feedback system theory inspired
3208880	3209880	by circuit theory.
3210480	3217200	And so if I'm campaigning for something, it's only to restore the importance of this
3217200	3222000	input-output approach and the value of the bridge between the input-output approach and
3222000	3226680	the state space approach. It's not at all against the, I mean, of course, the concept of
3226680	3232000	state space is extraordinarily important and a very, very important heritage of our
3232000	3233000	field.
3233880	3238080	Yeah, so I guess it would be more fair to say that you're campaigning to resurrect the
3238080	3243680	bridge that once upon a time was so evident and perhaps these days is not so much.
3243840	3244840	Yes.
3245880	3249360	I guess, again, here, from here, we could take many directions.
3249400	3254560	I have a couple of questions that I do want to ask you about, let's say, the implications
3254560	3258600	of your research in neuroscience before maybe we move on and touch on other topics.
3259440	3264240	Some of these are maybe a bit provocative and they're like the aim at fantasizing, if
3264240	3269720	you want, about what can we achieve if we understand the mechanisms by which neurons
3269720	3271840	or even the brain work?
3272040	3278520	So the question broadly would be really, what can we achieve, say, in the next decade, 20
3278520	3282240	years, 100 years, if we push forward this concept?
3282240	3286120	And, for example, I don't know, what can we say about perception?
3286160	3291960	How is it integrated or is there any hope about saying something about how consciousness
3291960	3292960	arises?
3294160	3301680	I'm not a neuroscientist, and so I don't think I'm qualified to make any prediction about
3301680	3302920	the future of neuroscience.
3302960	3310800	What I see through my colleagues who are neuroscientists is that there also there is a
3310920	3313280	resurrection of the cybernetics age.
3314000	3320640	So the whole effort of cybernetics was to think of the brain as a machine and to approach
3320640	3325720	the brain. So the British father of cybernetics, Ross Ashby, was not a control theorist, was
3325720	3327640	not an engineer. He was a psychiatrist.
3328720	3330520	And it was part of this.
3331040	3337160	It was very much at the genesis of cybernetics to approach the understanding of the brain
3337560	3339360	from an engineering perspective.
3339760	3347520	And then with the rise of molecular biology, neuroscience became a quantitative science
3347520	3355080	and it became very much dominated by a very scientific approach of describing the brain,
3355080	3360440	describing the anatomy of the brain, describing the anatomy of the neural circuits and
3360680	3365200	understanding the neural circuits from those scientific descriptions.
3365640	3370360	We see an illustration of that fact with, for instance, the emphasis nowadays on
3370360	3376840	connectomics, that, you know, as if understanding the connectome of a large network would
3376840	3378640	tell you how the network works.
3380040	3386680	And I think that nowadays there is more and more appreciation in neuroscience that if
3386680	3391040	we want to think of if we want to make progress in understanding the brain, it's not
3391040	3394480	enough to have this scientific description of the brain.
3394480	3398240	We need also to understand the mechanism of the brain.
3398240	3404000	And it's very valuable to approach those mechanisms from an engineering perspective.
3404720	3411560	And again, there is always a balance in neuroscience and in every science between science
3411560	3417840	and engineering. So in neuroscience, you have a balance between the quest of understanding
3417840	3422920	the brain and the medical desire of curing diseases.
3423000	3425760	OK, and there is a tension between those two.
3425760	3432560	But I think that the value of it's also that I love this claim of Feynman, who is
3432840	3438880	perhaps the most theoretical physicist of our time, but saying understanding is building.
3439040	3445120	So the idea that it is by building a machine that mimics the brain that we will
3445160	3446520	understand the brain.
3446600	3449480	I quite like that view and that approach.
3449480	3454920	And so that is closer to my field because control is about design.
3455400	3459440	And to me, control is design under uncertainty.
3460000	3466520	I think this is a concept that resonates very much with the current approach of thinking
3466520	3474360	of brain as producing extremely reliable functions out of huge uncertainty and
3474360	3476000	sloppiness in the components.
3476360	3482360	So how much so much variability in the anatomical components of the brain can lead to
3482360	3484680	such reliable brain functions?
3484960	3487880	I think that's a core question of neuroscience today.
3488760	3490760	That's why I think it's a control question.
3491080	3496920	And I think that as a control theorist, I see this as a key question for the future of
3496920	3499120	artificial intelligence and the future of robotics.
3499120	3505360	How can we design intelligence machines, so machines that are closer to what we
3505360	3511400	experience in natural intelligence and deal with the uncertainty and deal with the
3511480	3513680	sloppiness of the components?
3514040	3519720	And I expect a lot of progress and a lot of synergy and interaction between
3519720	3523320	neuroscience and control engineering along those lines.
3524680	3526800	So maybe we're going to cut this later.
3526800	3528600	So you mentioned at the outset.
3529080	3534240	So we're looking forward to seeing the relationship between control and neuroscience
3534240	3539760	condensing in your upcoming book with Guillaume Drion and Alessio Franchi, whose title
3539760	3544280	is, if I remember correctly, Neuromorphic Controlled Principles.
3544280	3544840	Is that right?
3545720	3546840	And we're looking forward to that.
3546880	3547400	Yeah.
3547680	3551200	You know, there are many, many books out there that are half written.
3552680	3557240	So we will see whether this book belongs to the category of published or never published
3557240	3559960	book. But no, no, I do think that this book will.
3561040	3563040	There are two reasons why you can write a book.
3563080	3566840	You either write a book because you want to learn a topic or you write a book because you
3566840	3568040	are an expert on the topic.
3568800	3574600	I like very much, I think it's Vidya Sagar who once told me that if you want to learn
3574600	3576520	about a topic, write a book on that topic.
3577480	3582280	There is no better way of learning than being forced to explaining concepts.
3583120	3588360	And again, we go back here to the tension again between teaching and researching, which is
3588560	3590240	very much intertwined, I would say.
3591240	3594280	I guess this is a good time to shift gears a little bit.
3594320	3598200	And I mean, there is a number of questions that I like to ask to our guests.
3598720	3604480	But first, I would like to maybe dig into, I would say, something like that I would call a
3604480	3606040	double life almost that you lived.
3606240	3612680	So you had time to explore optimization on manifolds in a book that potentially I think
3612680	3615360	it's your most cited publication so far.
3616040	3620160	And I remember having a conversation with you where essentially you told me that it
3620160	3624960	started as a hobby, almost it started as something that a side project, is that fair to
3624960	3630960	say? I wouldn't say a side project, but I would say as a sort of, yeah, as a journey.
3631520	3636600	So it is a side project, as you would decide to visit a country for a while and then come
3636600	3642320	back. And perhaps it's the first time in my career where I sort of venture into a
3642320	3649680	neighboring discipline because, yes, control is very much a science of optimization and a
3649680	3650800	science of feedback.
3651240	3654680	But I think that optimization is not specific to controls.
3654680	3660240	Optimization is somehow a driving paradigm in many disciplines.
3660920	3666000	So also having ventured in optimization for a while and having come back to control, I now
3666000	3672080	consider that out of the two, feedback is really what is the distinctive feature of
3672080	3679760	control theory and that control theory exists as what it is because it addresses it.
3679760	3685840	I think it's the only science in my view that really addressed the question of feedback at
3685840	3691680	its core. So venturing in neighboring disciplines showed me the value of traveling and
3691680	3698600	traveling abroad and learning another language and also appreciating how difficult it is
3698600	3702840	and how time consuming it is to learn the language of another community.
3703360	3707360	I used that skill later on when I decided to venture in neuroscience.
3707360	3709960	So it was sort of a first step.
3710160	3717600	And then perhaps realizing that by moving to neighboring disciplines, you can potentially
3717600	3721400	contribute to the discipline in a very original way.
3722160	3729160	Not necessarily being more clever than your peers, but having these different insights that
3729160	3731760	comes from the diversity I was talking before.
3732320	3739480	And so, of course, I'm very glad of the success of optimization on manifolds a posteriori
3739640	3741520	because it was totally unexpected.
3742000	3748120	And clearly working on that topic in the early 2000s was working on a very esoteric topic.
3748720	3754560	And seeing that now this topic has become widespread in machine learning and computer
3754560	3761880	vision and is, of course, very rewarding and to me, encouraging about the value of
3761880	3767920	diversity, about the value of jumping in a neighboring community and saying, OK, this is
3767920	3770160	what matters in my field.
3770200	3773800	Do you think it might be of relevance in your field as well?
3774360	3778000	And in that case, it was the role of invariance.
3778520	3783680	You know, we put a lot of attention to invariance properties when we do physical
3783680	3790680	modeling in control and the geometric thinking in control is very much rooted in an
3790680	3794960	effort to formulate questions in a sort of coordinate free manner.
3794960	3801080	And so in ways that are invariant as much as possible and approaching the design of
3801240	3807720	optimization algorithms with this particular angle was not common at all, certainly at the
3807720	3813800	time. And of course, it's of great relevance in a number of engineering disciplines where
3814400	3819920	let's say you want to computer vision algorithms to be invariance to the motion of the
3819920	3821280	camera or things like that.
3821520	3825840	We can think of many problems where invariance are of tremendous importance.
3825840	3833720	And yeah, to me, it was that's what I learned from my journey in optimization, that by
3833800	3837880	venturing in a neighboring field, well, first of all, it is very challenging because you
3837880	3839240	have to learn a new language.
3839640	3846040	Second of all, perhaps the way you can contribute there is by using your own identity and
3846040	3849440	using the diversity that you are bringing in a different community.
3849440	3858760	And so I became sort of more confident that indeed diversity is something very rewarding in
3858760	3860720	science and very important in science.
3862080	3865240	Again, there's a lot of meat to unpack there.
3865520	3869440	You're indirectly addressing one of the questions that I would have asked you before,
3869760	3874120	actually later about advice to future students, potentially.
3874360	3879560	Another thing that you touched on that I think is important is the relevance of
3879560	3884800	conceptualizing almost in a representation free manner, if that makes sense.
3884800	3891560	So that is something that is very much at the core of much of the research of Jan Willems in
3891560	3893480	the field of systems theory.
3894000	3896600	So this is actually one of the questions that I wanted to ask you.
3896600	3900200	And maybe then I'll try to close the loop on optimization of manifold.
3900200	3904880	But would it be fair to say that he was one of the most inspiring figures for you?
3904880	3907080	And if you had to name three, who would they be?
3907440	3912120	I know it's a tough question and it will definitely be do injustice to some.
3912360	3913560	Yeah, well.
3914680	3920800	There is no question that Jan Willems would be one of the three and that I think it is his
3920800	3928320	research that has been perhaps most influential on my research in exactly what you were
3928320	3936240	saying in the importance of questions and the importance of formulating a question in a
3936240	3937600	mathematically precise.
3937880	3944240	So this tension about picking your questions out of conceptual questions, like what is
3944240	3946720	positive feedback? It's a very conceptual question.
3947120	3953200	But then turning that conceptual questions into something that becomes mathematically
3953200	3958840	precise. I think that the research of Jan Willems in that regard is really remarkable.
3959120	3965560	And I have no doubt that it will be a longstanding heritage for the field for that reason.
3966320	3972760	If I have to think of other names, well, clearly I would mention my mentor, who is Peter
3972760	3977920	Kokotowicz. And Peter Kokotowicz influenced me in a very different way than Jan Willems.
3978520	3983360	It's not so much the research, I think, that influenced me, but the attitudes towards
3983360	3989960	research. And probably that today, when I have to make a decision about what to do, what not
3989960	3996040	to do, how to do something, the person that most frequently comes to mind is Peter
3996040	3999600	Kokotowicz. So what would have he done in this situation?
3999600	4001480	What would have been his advice?
4002040	4005480	And it is in that sense that I consider him as my mentor.
4006000	4012120	He certainly taught me the value of history and the fact that you cannot understand the
4012120	4016120	concept until you have unfolded the history of that concept.
4016600	4018720	I find this extremely important.
4019280	4024600	In science, we often have a negative vision on history, on the whole of history.
4024760	4026680	Oh, history is looking backwards.
4027040	4028520	Science should look forward.
4028520	4036160	And, yeah, I do think that the best way to look forward is first to look in the past
4036280	4042680	what is useful to move forward and take heritage of what was known in the past.
4044400	4049360	A third name, I'm afraid would not be a name, but I would like to mention here really the
4049360	4054880	role of my students and postdocs, including you, Alberto, because I think that and I
4054880	4060800	mentioned that earlier, that in those conversations that make you realize that you
4060800	4066560	didn't formulate clearly what you thought you were formulating clearly, those
4066560	4069680	conversations are the motor of my research.
4070280	4074600	And those conversations can, of course, happen with colleagues and with anyone.
4074600	4079840	But nothing replaces the role of students and postdocs in my experience in that
4079840	4085480	journey. So because with a postdoc or with a PhD student, you develop a sort of a
4085480	4088560	relationship over a number of years.
4089160	4093200	And so this conversation over time becomes very intimate.
4094200	4100280	And really pushes you to the heart of the matter in a way that is unmatched, I think.
4100640	4107240	So, again, the value of teaching and mentoring as the motor of research, it is
4107240	4110600	something that is very much part of my identity, I think.
4111840	4113040	That's fantastic.
4113600	4119120	Again, you keep on serving me assists about how to proceed forward, and it's always
4119120	4122920	difficult to choose because there's so many avenues that are interesting.
4123240	4127280	So I mentioned earlier that I wanted to close the loop with optimization of manifolds.
4127280	4129840	And we mentioned the value of history as well.
4130240	4134680	So I think this is a good time to ask the question of pondering about the past, the
4134680	4141080	present and the future of our field and of the fields you ventured into, if you have
4141080	4142240	any thoughts.
4142240	4147520	So I guess the question could be phrased as what are you most excited about in the years
4147520	4150680	to come? What are the technologies that we should look for?
4151160	4156040	And yeah, what are the questions maybe that systems and control theory should address?
4157240	4162680	OK, I think that it's probably clear from what I discussed before, I'm very excited by
4163000	4166600	the role of cybernetics right after the Second World War.
4167120	4174240	I'm very puzzled by the fact that this period was so short lived and that somehow the
4174240	4180080	publication of the book Cybernetics was the end of the cybernetics age because of
4180720	4185960	information theory and because of the invention of the computer that put an end somehow to
4185960	4191640	the needs of thinking of machines and animals in the same framework.
4192000	4197960	I think we are returning to the cybernetics questions and I think that this will occupy a
4197960	4203280	lot of researchers, not just in control, but also in control in the future.
4203680	4208680	I think that we have reached a stage where we see the limitations of machine learning.
4209440	4214800	We have reached a stage where we see the limitations of digital technology and we see
4214800	4222120	that the limitations of those two extremely successful developments of the second half of
4222120	4229880	the 20th century, that the limitations of those technologies come from the uncertainty
4230040	4234960	and come from the difficulty of handling and coping with uncertainty.
4236080	4238520	So this is a perfect age for control.
4239080	4246400	And I think that control will have, in my view, control has a very glorious future ahead.
4247080	4249280	First of all, because it's a very young science.
4249360	4256000	I keep thinking that control became science after the Second World War.
4256040	4257400	So it's very recently.
4257880	4263280	And that success of control is really designed under uncertainty, as I've said before.
4263400	4269640	And we have no shortage of engineering and technological challenges where we have to cope
4269640	4270520	with uncertainty.
4271240	4275760	But of course, we have to pay attention to what is happening and we have to pay attention to
4275760	4279160	how we can contribute to what is happening.
4279160	4283680	And in that regard, I have come to regard the question of feedback as really the core
4283680	4285240	question of control theory.
4285920	4292440	And I think that nowadays, perhaps a lot of research in our community has moved away from
4292440	4299000	the core question of feedback, has also perhaps moved away from the question of uncertainty
4299280	4305320	because of the prevalence of optimisation and machine learning and the fascination of what
4305320	4308040	you can do with the digital computation.
4308800	4311080	And again, don't take me wrong.
4311280	4317400	It's not that I would want to campaign against that, but it is that I think that the future
4317400	4325280	of control is in identifying that the way we can contribute to this field and to engineering
4325280	4332520	in general is really by our unique way of approaching the question of uncertainty and how
4332520	4339760	we cope with uncertainty and how we can, thanks to feedback, turn very uncertain devices
4339760	4342120	into certain functions.
4343120	4349200	This is a very fascinating picture of the future in a way, which, again, keeps on serving me
4349200	4352080	answers about questions that I have for you.
4352080	4357640	And one that I tend to ask to every guest here is about advice to future generations.
4358120	4363920	So if the question could be phrased as like, what are the most important traits that
4363920	4367560	successful researcher in our field should have?
4367960	4373400	Or is there anything that you wish you knew something about, say, when you started your
4373400	4378080	career? What sort of advice could you give to future students in control?
4378520	4383080	It's a very open ended question and it could be also like, what should they invest on, for
4383080	4383560	example?
4384200	4390240	Right. Perhaps what I would answer, it's not so much the what that matters, but the how
4391200	4392200	and the why.
4393120	4402120	And so I think you can, at least for a long, even in the PhD, there is this tension between
4402600	4404280	research and education.
4404400	4411400	You do a PhD, I often tell my students, maybe I told you that before, what I learned in
4411400	4414080	my PhD is how not to do research.
4414760	4419360	And perhaps this is the most important skill that you need to develop at an early stage
4419360	4426080	of your career, because everyone starts research with the ambition of, you know, solving
4426080	4428920	new questions, identifying the important questions.
4428920	4437000	And but what you learn by doing research is that the difficulty is not to find difficult
4437000	4439000	questions. There are plenty.
4439600	4442480	The difficulty is to respond.
4442520	4449280	The difficulty is to resonate with a question of your time and to develop skills that
4449280	4456520	eventually will give you a competitive advantage or a unique angle of attack to address
4456520	4462920	some questions. And that happens, again, as in the same way as I was talking about the
4462920	4465720	trajectory, that happens through a sequence of events.
4466040	4469720	And I think that the events themselves are not that important.
4470000	4474560	It's really that you have to learn how you respond to events and you have to find your
4474560	4477080	own identity in the way you respond to events.
4477760	4483720	And, yeah, of course, ultimately, the advice comes from Socrata, Knotis Eotan, once if
4483720	4488480	you know yourself, if you know your limitation, if you know what you can do well, you will
4488480	4494520	do well. And perhaps that's that's the most important question that we need to learn at
4494520	4499400	an early stage of our career is to try to learn something about ourselves.
4500400	4507480	Maybe the last question I have before closing this episode relates to something that I am
4507480	4511160	thinking about a lot these days, and that's the concept of creativity.
4511840	4516200	I think you're one of the most creative persons I've met so far in my life.
4518360	4520520	And so I have a question for you.
4520520	4524120	I mean, I'll start with maybe a quote from David Bohm.
4524120	4529480	David Bohm is writing the following in wholeness and the implicate order.
4529960	4534800	He writes, one prerequisite of originality is clearly that a person shall not be inclined
4534800	4538120	to impose his preconceptions on the fact as he sees it.
4538800	4543680	Rather, he must be able to learn something new, even if it means that the ideas and the
4543680	4546920	notions that are comfortable or dear to him may be overturned.
4547360	4552000	And this is something that seems to very much resonate with what you were mentioning
4552000	4555320	before. So I guess the question would be here.
4555720	4560680	Is there anything, any sort of advice that you can give to generate creativity?
4562040	4566560	Well, you are very generous, and I'm not sure I would identify myself as someone
4566640	4573000	particularly creative, but I love this quote of Daniel Barenboim, who is a great
4573000	4578760	pianist, and he says music teaches us the difference between freedom and anarchy.
4578920	4585520	And I think that scientific creativity, very much like creativity in art, is a very
4585520	4589680	fine balance between constraints and imagination.
4590800	4596800	And it seems to me, but perhaps this is personal, that it is the most constrained
4597200	4600560	type of art that leads to the biggest creativity.
4601360	4605720	So, for instance, I don't think there is a stronger illustration of that than the
4605720	4612760	music of Bach. The music of Bach is almost mathematical in a way, in the sense that it
4612760	4615560	obeys such strict rules.
4616200	4623360	How comes that throughout centuries it generates so much emotion, including in
4623360	4628520	people who have no musical education, who don't know about the constraints?
4629480	4635000	And I think that in our field, again, we are back to the fact that control is at the
4635000	4639400	same time a very mathematical science, but a science of something very concrete.
4640080	4645800	So I think that the best creativity that I see in control is the one very much
4645800	4649480	constrained by mathematics and by the rules of mathematics.
4650240	4657720	And how you find a place for novel, for innovation in those rules is a bit of a
4657720	4663080	mystery. And this is where the concreteness of the environment plays its role.
4664040	4671120	So the pianist who creates emotion from a piece of Bach might create emotion today and
4671120	4672640	totally fail tomorrow.
4673480	4678400	He might create emotion in you today, not in me and tomorrow in me and not in you.
4678400	4684560	So it's always about, and I think pianists would tell us that it's about a resonance
4684560	4687600	with the public. This resonance is really two sided.
4687600	4688560	It's not one side.
4688560	4690640	So you don't have entire control on it.
4691040	4695720	But you are the one who know the constraints, who have to operate under the
4695720	4702080	constraints. And somehow by acknowledging that those constraints are a prerequisite
4702200	4709120	for emotion and for that will happen in a somewhat uncontrolled way.
4709960	4714560	Perhaps I would think that this is a very important, at least part of creativity.
4714560	4716280	So creativity is much more than that.
4716280	4723240	But it is an element of creativity that has always fascinated me because I find that
4723360	4726400	research in control is very constrained.
4726920	4730240	You know, sorry to again talk about feedback.
4730720	4737720	I cannot help. But constraining a concept like feedback with mathematics seems like
4737720	4740400	you are. Why do you do that?
4741320	4746840	What is the value of constraining such a beautiful concept with the rules of logics?
4746840	4751920	And that is exactly the mystery of science and art.
4751920	4756880	I think that it is because the concept is not enough.
4756880	4762080	It is the communication of the concept that is as important as the concept.
4762920	4766760	And the communication uses those constraints.
4767600	4773360	So communication in science uses mathematics as a channel.
4774280	4781480	And this channel is indispensable to communicate and to exchange about the concept of
4781480	4784920	feedback that creates emotion in you and me.
4784920	4788760	But definitely a different one in you and different in me.
4789200	4795600	And if we don't have this mathematical language, we never know whether what we express
4795600	4803720	about the concept is indeed resonating with what your interlocutor thinks of the
4803720	4807000	concept. Sorry if this is too long of an answer.
4808320	4813480	It's absolutely not. I mean, it's very much resonating with, I guess, with Galileo.
4813520	4818120	So the world is written in the language of the universe is mathematics.
4818520	4822880	Since we're talking about creativity, I mean, there is abundant evidence that shows that
4823120	4826000	one thing that seems to stimulate creativity is walking.
4826640	4830400	And I know you're an incredibly avid hiker.
4830400	4835520	So in closing the episode, I thought it would be nice to ask you what is on your to-do list
4835520	4838080	there? Like, is there anything that you have planned?
4838800	4843720	Well, there the list is too long to be closed in one lifetime.
4843840	4848680	So I hope my legs can bring me to a lot of new paths.
4849320	4854520	I must say that and perhaps this has been a consequence of the pandemics that I've
4854520	4860640	discovered that walking 10 miles from home can create the same emotion as walking on
4860640	4861760	the other side of the planet.
4862360	4871040	So maybe, you know, when I was younger, my to-do list includes a very famous treks and
4871040	4872280	very challenging ones.
4873240	4879680	But I've come to appreciate that it is the activity of walking that is wonderful and
4879680	4885120	that very often and certainly in my case, I'm lucky that I don't have to walk very far
4885120	4889840	from home to find wonderful landscapes and to enjoy walking.
4890280	4898280	So I hope I will walk as much as possible and in the future and for as long as
4898280	4903560	possible. But I don't care too much where I will walk, to be honest.
4904400	4910720	But definitely, I agree that there is something quite fascinating about walking, also
4910720	4914760	for a control engineer, because we try to build walking machines.
4914760	4924400	And I also wrote an editorial about rhythm recently and rhythm are definitely a very,
4924440	4927160	very important aspect of animal machines.
4927160	4930680	And walking is a very important activity.
4931160	4936040	And I recently heard a very, very interesting conversation on the team of walking
4936040	4939080	between philosopher and a neurophysiologist.
4939080	4943600	And so the question was, is walking thinking or is thinking walking?
4944640	4950600	That resonates a lot with me as well, that certainly most of my thinking is while
4950600	4953480	walking in my personal experience.
4954200	4959520	But it is also a fact, and this was the point of the neurologist, that in fact, the more
4959520	4965960	we study the brain, the more we tend to think of the activity of thinking very much as
4965960	4971360	we think of the activity of walking and of, in fact, any other rhythmic activity of the
4971360	4978360	body. So the rhythmic nature of thinking, I think, is of great importance and again, a
4978360	4980480	natural place for control.
