00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,040
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,200
Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Centre of Competence in Research on Dependable Ubiquitous

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,360
Automation, as well as the International Federation of Automatic Control.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Our guest today is Rodolf Sapulka, from the University of Cambridge, is Professor of Engineering

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,160
in the Control Group.

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,840
Welcome to the show, Rodolf.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Thank you.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
And good morning, Alberto.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,120
So I should probably give a small disclaimer that I've been spending a lot of time with

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Rodolf over three years in Cambridge.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,320
Some time ago in my past, it's been a pleasure to do so and so it will be potentially a semi

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,440
different episode in the sense that I know you better than other people.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,440
And so having spent quite some time together, I know you are an avid reader and an avid

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
hiker.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,880
So I guess just to break the ice, I'm curious about knowing what is on your reading list

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
at the moment.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Wow.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,880
A very unexpected question.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,880
There are always many things on the reading list.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,960
But actually, there is nothing on the reading list right at the minute, strangely enough.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,680
And often the best novels that I've read, I discovered them by complete accident, for

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
instance, in the bookstore of an airport.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,360
And so I'm always, I like to be surprised.

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,400
And sometimes this leads to the best reads.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm curious.

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,680
So, OK, one quote, one from one of your favorite readers is Oran Pamuk, a Nobel Prize in Literature

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
in 2006.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,660
So he said in The New Life, I read a book one day and my whole life was changed.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,720
So if that were to be the book, which one would it be for you?

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Which book?

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Yes.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
That changed my life.

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Yeah.

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:22,800
I don't think I could single out one book also because books, yeah, maybe it will be

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
a strange answer to your question.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,560
But as a teenager, I was totally fascinated by Dostoyevsky.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,200
And then there was a strange event that occurred to me when I was around 40.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,960
And one day I picked a book of Dostoyevsky and I said, let's go back to it.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,680
And I stopped after three pages.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,880
And I realized at that time that the emotion that you can experience while reading a book

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:02,360
is extremely dependent on your age, your environment, your stage in life.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,400
And so I think that it's not that certain books are objectively monuments.

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
Of course they are.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,860
But I think it's always a story of resonance.

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:22,040
And so it's a resonance at a particular time for a special reason between the reader and

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,240
the writer.

49
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,720
That's how I would describe my experience with books.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,960
I actually love this answer because it kind of adds a dynamic element to a book.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,800
It's not something that is there forever, but it really has to be a synergy between

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,760
the reader and the book itself.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,080
It's always an encounter.

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Yes.

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
Very fascinating.

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,040
So since you mentioned you being a teenager, I like to always draw a sort of picture of

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,800
your trajectory as a human.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Yeah.

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,360
So I'm curious about what brought you to control.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,120
So like, what is it about, say, your environment or your childhood or anything that you can

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,080
think of that brought you to control?

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
That's very hard to answer.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,240
Again, I don't have a very clear answer.

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,360
I can pinpoint events that eventually brought me where I am.

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,200
And so one event that perhaps I could tell about what led me to control, even though

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,280
it has nothing to do with control, is that it was my second year of engineering.

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,600
And it was the course of thermodynamics, which was definitely not my favorite subject at

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
the time.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,320
But I remember very vividly that the professor once entered the classroom and was nearly

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,320
shooting at us and saying, have you heard of what has just been reported that for the

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,640
first time ever, one has observed superconductivity above 30 degrees Kelvin.

72
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,760
And that experiments will change the world.

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,360
And he went on and for the best part of the lecture, he just told us about these experiments

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,280
and why it was fascinating and what would be the consequence of it.

75
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,480
And I don't remember anything of what he told, but I do remember his eyes.

76
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,280
And I do remember the light and I would say the fire during that lecture.

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,080
And perhaps it is the moment in my life where I sort of experienced for the first time that

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,900
there is such an intimate connection between teaching and research.

79
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,760
And I would say that today I would pinpoint that event as something that led me to my

80
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,840
profession, even though I'm sure that at the time, you know, it was just a complete accident.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,200
Perhaps this professor doesn't remember that he told those stories.

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Again, it is a sort of a resonance that is completely accidental.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,200
And I think of any trajectory as somehow interpolating between those events.

84
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,120
And those events are always independent of you.

85
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
They are very accidental.

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,920
So you could wonder whether how an identity can be defined by such stochastic events.

87
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:23,080
But at the same time, I like to think that where I am today is not that dependent on

88
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,840
those events and that perhaps a completely different sequence of events would have led

89
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,640
to a trajectory that would not be so different.

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
And to me, this is a mystery of life.

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,120
The fact that we are so much determined by accidental events.

92
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,640
And at the same time, our own identity is not so much in these events, but how we respond

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,000
to those events.

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,040
And maybe this is my fascination for control theory, because after all, control theory

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,040
is a science where you study the interaction between the external and the internal.

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,160
We study how systems respond to disturbances.

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,440
I find this quite deep and central to engineering, actually.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,160
And decision making is the only lever that you can pull somehow.

99
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,800
I mean, it's definitely fascinating.

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,560
I guess the only comment I have is that in a sense, one cannot repeat the experiment

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,520
as to the best of our knowledge.

102
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Absolutely.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,280
So we don't know who we would be with another sequence of events.

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,720
But this is not something that causes me any anxiety, I would say.

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,240
It's also a fact that all these events that I sort of would pinpoint today to define my

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,680
trajectory always involve human beings and always involve encounters, those resonance

107
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,160
that I was talking about earlier.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,600
I cannot remember reading a book or reading a text and saying, this is going to change

109
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
my life.

110
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,440
But I can pinpoint a sentence that someone told me and that somehow became very important

111
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
in my life.

112
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Yeah.

113
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,720
That changed the course of events in a sense.

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,960
Well, I mean, I guess one of the things that I really want to mention is that, you know,

115
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,840
by interacting with you over the years, one of the things I learned from you is an appreciation

116
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,360
for the history of a problem.

117
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,360
And so I found a very nice quote from Kepler from the Astronomia Nova.

118
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,120
So he says, the roads by which men arrive at their insights into celestial matters seem

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
to me almost as worthy of wonder as those matters themselves.

120
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,880
So today I would like to try and draw, you know, your trajectory.

121
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,480
You started from at least academically speaking from a paper with your PhD advisor, stability

122
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,800
for dynamical systems with first integrals, a topological criteria.

123
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,280
So something very mathematical and very much rooted in nonlinear control.

124
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,040
And today I would say that your manifesto that we will talk about certainly in a second

125
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,220
is towards building spiking control systems.

126
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,000
So how do we connect these two points?

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
What happened in the middle?

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,880
Yeah, again, it's a very strange sequence of events and the events don't really explain

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,320
the outcome.

130
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,880
But I think that control theory requires a lot of mathematical abstraction.

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,920
And at the same time, I think that control theory to me is really engineering driven.

132
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,240
So the important contributions of control have always come from very concrete engineering

133
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,880
questions.

134
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,480
And it is this meeting point between the abstraction and the concreteness of the questions that

135
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,420
attracts me and that I think has always attracted me in control.

136
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,360
So my engineering education was quite mathematical.

137
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:06,660
In fact, my specialty was mathematical engineering, if such a thing exists.

138
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,960
So definitely I had a taste for mathematics, as I think many people in control have.

139
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,920
But over the years, I became more and more sympathetic to the concreteness of control.

140
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,440
And this is also what I like about the basic control courses, is that it's hard, I think,

141
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,920
to pinpoint other courses early in the curriculum, where there is such a bridge made between,

142
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,800
you know, the very concrete questions of making the speed of a motor insensitive to

143
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,960
load and complex analysis.

144
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,520
How comes that those things connect to each other?

145
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,160
How comes that a little bit of abstraction is so powerful in providing such concrete

146
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,040
answer that I find fascinating in control?

147
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,440
I totally agree.

148
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,440
And probably I wouldn't even have started this podcast if I weren't so fascinated.

149
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,840
I guess here we are almost at a crossing point in the sense that we can either follow

150
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,800
the chronological course of events and, you know, follow your trajectory starting from

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,920
deep theoretical questions in nonlinear control or start in a bit of an unusual way right

152
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
from the present.

153
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
So what keeps you busy these days?

154
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,640
And I would probably ask you, actually, what do you prefer?

155
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,120
I have no preference.

156
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,040
Of course, it's always easier to speak about the presence.

157
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,360
That's what, you know, keeps me awake.

158
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,920
So let's speak about the present.

159
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,800
I think the present is a very exciting thing to talk about.

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,360
At least I was reading the other day your paper on the IEEE proceedings, Spiking Control

161
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,440
Systems, to me that is really a manifesto almost towards what are you going to do over

162
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,640
the probably the next decade, I believe.

163
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,120
I really liked one quote where you say explicitly, we aim at developing a control theory of spiking

164
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,720
systems which will apply both to the natural world of biophysical neural circuits and the

165
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
post digital technology of event based systems.

166
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,080
I think that sentence is a masterpiece.

167
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:22,280
And it somehow is transparent that you also want to inherit all the heritage from cybernetics.

168
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,480
But moving forward, you want to incorporate new knowledge, let's say, coming from control

169
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,280
systems and the mixed feedback principle that we will definitely talk about in a second.

170
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,480
So what is your goal and your motivation, I would say, as well?

171
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, my motivation is very clearly to focus on the importance of event based systems and

172
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,040
event based control.

173
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,960
As a topic that has received, I would consider very, very little attention in control.

174
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:03,360
The name I think was quote uncoined by Karl Astrum and his book chapter of 2007 that is

175
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,940
called event based control.

176
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,600
My reading of that book chapter is that itself it builds upon a paper that Karl Astrum wrote

177
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,520
in 1991, together with Carl Vermeet, the father of neuromorphic engineering.

178
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,280
And that brings the importance of events.

179
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:28,360
And it's very, very defeating to talk about events and to do research about events nowadays,

180
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,840
because our language and the language of information engineering has become so divided between

181
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,560
the analog language on the one hand and digital language on the other hand.

182
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,760
And events are clearly something that mixed the continuous and the digital.

183
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,040
And as a control theorist, I've come to regard this story as a story of mixed feedback, the

184
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,520
positive feedback being associated to discrete states and by stability and automata and the

185
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:08,320
language of digital technology, and negative feedback being associated with homeostasis,

186
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,920
regulation, and the theory of continuous regulation.

187
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,760
It is only through time and because I was studying neuroscience and because I started

188
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,880
reading what I was seeing in neuroscience as a theory of mixed feedback that I became

189
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,360
aware that in fact cybernetics was a science of mixed feedback.

190
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,400
And I think many people in the community would agree that the cybernetics age was a sort

191
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,800
of a golden age, very short lived golden age of control.

192
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,440
And that nowadays there are many signs that we are sort of returning to that age.

193
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,400
But much better equipped, because in the meantime, we have developed fantastic tools

194
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:57,400
that we can now use to reconsider questions that perhaps were ahead of their time.

195
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:06,480
But definitely my view is that the digital age created this strong separation between

196
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,880
positive feedback and negative feedback and that control theory became a theory of negative

197
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,600
feedback and that it is a little bit today the trap where control theory or the corner

198
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,800
where control theory is sitting, and that there is so much more to explore and to be

199
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:32,960
connected both to biology, but also to now these fast developing event-based sensors

200
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,720
and event-based actuators that is opening so many new questions and new path of research

201
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,120
for control theories that I find is very, very exciting.

202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,920
There's a lot to unpack in what you just said.

203
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,200
I just want to maybe mention a couple of things for our audience.

204
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,280
And then I guess we will delve into some of the concepts that you mentioned so far.

205
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,400
So first of all, I just want to mention to the audience of control theory, let's say

206
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,880
that who Carver Mead is.

207
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Carver Mead worked with John Hopfield and Richard Feynman, novelist, helping to create

208
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,920
three new fields, neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and the physics of computation.

209
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Just to name a few, he founded at least 20 companies from integrated circuits to silicon

210
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,360
sensors for photographic imaging.

211
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,000
So he was really a pioneering figure in the history of science.

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,160
But since you were mentioning, first of all, the notion of mixed feedback or the mixed

213
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,840
feedback principle, maybe we should try to unpack that.

214
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,400
So what does that imply or how can we explain, let's say, to our audience, what is the mixed

215
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,480
feedback principle?

216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,760
So the mixed feedback terminology comes from the mixed feedback amplifier that features

217
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:57,240
the cover of the well-known textbooks of electrical circuits by Desueur and Shua from the 80s.

218
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,880
And on the cover of the textbooks, you see the op-amp with a wire both connected to the

219
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,880
negative part of the, so a feedback wire, a wire connecting the output of the amplifier

220
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,360
both to the negative part of the amplifier and to the positive part of the amplifier.

221
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,720
And the story of the feedback amplifier that we know in control theory, that I knew in

222
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,400
control theory, was the story of negative feedback.

223
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,800
Historically, things went the other way around.

224
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:34,720
The first use of the op-amp was the positive feedback amplifier, because that was the way

225
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,360
to design switches in analog systems.

226
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,400
And so until the Second World War, the only way to realize switching circuits and circuits

227
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,000
that were not equilibrium circuits was through positive feedback amplifiers.

228
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:58,400
And this makes the discovery of Black, of the negative feedback amplifier, only more

229
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,600
impressive that he had this vision that there could be a use of connecting the output of

230
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,600
the op-amp to the negative part, because that would make the op-amp less sensitive to

231
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,760
disturbance, less sensitive to uncertainty.

232
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,680
And so we know that it took, I think, nine years for Black to get his discovery patented.

233
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,480
And so that shows the spirit of the time, that why would you ever connect the output

234
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,440
of a system to the negative part?

235
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,080
And today we have just the opposite view, at least as a student.

236
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,920
And I remember speaking to some control theorists and talking to them about positive feedback

237
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:48,160
and seeing that face, that why would you ever connect the output of an op-amp to the positive part?

238
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:55,200
And then the way I read any device in the body, and in particular in the brain, is a

239
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
mixed feedback amplifier.

240
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,000
And so nature somehow is making use of this mixed feedback amplification all the time.

241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,720
And I think for very good reasons.

242
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,120
So yeah, this is my short story of the mixed feedback concept.

243
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,280
Maybe like just to help the audience grasp what it really means.

244
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,880
So I guess what you're advocating is that in a feedback loop, there's always, if we're

245
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,760
interested, let's say, in building systems that range, let's say, from the analog behavior

246
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,480
to the digital behavior, we should mix, really have elements that both have positive feedback

247
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,720
and negative feedback in order to be able to capture, let's say, almost all behaviors

248
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
of interest.

249
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Is that fair to say?

250
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:51,160
But at least in my view, to sort of reunite the two branches of control that are automation

251
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,720
and regulation.

252
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,440
So today, you know, the conferences are different, the classes are different, the textbooks are

253
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,920
different, and you choose your side.

254
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:09,680
Either you study automation through automata to the language of discrete states, finite

255
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:16,000
state machines, or you study continuous control systems, and the world of regulation and the

256
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,080
world of which is fundamentally an analog world.

257
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,360
And I think that the best of those two worlds comes together when you consider mixed feedback.

258
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,760
Something that was sort of, I think, very well appreciated in the 40s, the time where

259
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,240
of the golden age of the mixed feedback amplifier, but then somehow disappeared from the field.

260
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,080
I guess this is a good point where to mention how does the mixed feedback principle enter

261
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
into the picture of neuroscience?

262
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,560
So I guess we could mention some of the paradigmatic models of how a single neuron behaves.

263
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
That's probably a good example.

264
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,920
Well, of course, the fundamental model of neuronal excitability that goes back to Hodgkin

265
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:11,600
and Huxley in 1952, is precisely the model of explaining the action potential of a neuron,

266
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,480
so the spike, as through the analogy of an electrical circuit, where you attach to an

267
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,680
RC circuit, so a passive circuit, you attach two current sources, one providing positive

268
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,880
feedback and the other one providing negative feedback.

269
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,240
And identifying those two current sources was the fundamental insight of Hodgkin and

270
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,080
Huxley and is the mechanism of thresholds.

271
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:47,200
And so what we, I think, the fundamental elements that we now see appearing in technology is

272
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
the value of thresholds.

273
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,120
And so as long as you use negative feedback, as long as you only consider negative feedback

274
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,800
control, you are in the world of equilibrium systems, so you always reject disturbance

275
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,760
and try to go back to equilibrium.

276
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,620
The world of mixed feedback introduced this notion of threshold, that if the disturbance

277
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:15,840
exceeds a certain level, you want to signal the disturbance and you signal through an

278
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,240
event and that event is a spike and that event can be transmitted, can be communicated, there

279
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,680
is something happening.

280
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,480
I find this extremely important in every behavior and of course we could take the example

281
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:38,240
of robotics, but in fact any single control system that you look at is just jumping from

282
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,440
event to event.

283
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,820
And again, that goes back very much to the early view of cybernetics and I like the one

284
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,940
of Ross Ashby in particular, who developed this concept of ultra-stability, thinking

285
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:02,260
of machines as systems that switch between discrete states, like an automaton, however

286
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,660
each of these states being continuously regulated.

287
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:13,780
And so it is sort of a mixture between an automaton and it's a regulated automaton.

288
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,980
It is a concept that is very, very clear and present in the early days of cybernetics,

289
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,420
but there was no theory at the time to formulate that concept.

290
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,780
And I think that, so that has been at the core of my research to try to now use the

291
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:39,980
current theory of control to formulate what would be and how should we model such a machine.

292
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,940
Since you mentioned the notion of, you know, dynamics away from equilibrium, this is just

293
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
a personal curiosity.

294
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,820
Have you ever thought about like the links between what you're studying today and thermodynamics?

295
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,220
So something that you didn't like so much.

296
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,780
So it seems like at least locally, you're going against the principles of thermodynamics,

297
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,940
you're generating order in a way, I don't know if I'm making sense.

298
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:14,820
I think that thermodynamics away from equilibrium, as it was developed in the 80s and very popular

299
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:24,900
in the 90s, is indeed very much the analog of the way, you know, chemical reactions and

300
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,820
which at the end, those neurons are made of.

301
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:35,580
So how can chemical reactions away from equilibrium generate order, generate patterns, generate...

302
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:43,340
So at sort of a high conceptual level, yes, there is clearly a lot of resonance between

303
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,980
the idea of thermodynamics out of equilibrium and the idea of control out of equilibrium.

304
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,140
But of course, and I'm not an expert of thermodynamics, but when I discuss thermodynamics out of equilibrium

305
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,300
with experts, I hear that we are very far away from having a proper theory of thermodynamics

306
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
away from equilibrium.

307
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,420
It's probably too early to talk about these questions.

308
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,580
Somebody who will listen to this podcast in the future, 50 years away from now, will have

309
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,380
some answers, hopefully.

310
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,820
Since you mentioned event-based systems, and I guess one of the main applications you have

311
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,300
in mind are potentially event-based cameras, I think maybe we can dig into that.

312
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,180
So I guess those are the applications you have in mind, probably.

313
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
Is that fair to say?

314
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,340
Or is that more a twist?

315
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:37,460
Well, I think that when I talk about mixed feedback, people often talk about my interest

316
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
in neuroscience.

317
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,140
And indeed, it is because of my interest in neuroscience that I became interested in mixed

318
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,820
feedback and that I became sort of obsessed to try to reconcile theory, control theory

319
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,740
with the mixed feedback principle.

320
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,980
But in the recent years, and since I sort of discovered this whole community of neuromorphic

321
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,740
engineering and event-based sensing, it occurred to me that in fact, even away from neuroscience,

322
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,420
there is a huge potential of exploring event-based control.

323
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,220
And for instance, if you look at the book chapter of Karl Armstrong on event-based control,

324
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,940
his motivation comes from all possible applications of control, but neuroscience.

325
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:29,860
So it's also a way for me to sort of go back in my home country, which is the theory of

326
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,340
control systems, and to think away from neuroscience of the potential use of mixed feedback or

327
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,700
the potential use of thresholds.

328
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:46,540
And clearly, we now see an explosion of event-based sensors and event-based actuators.

329
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:52,500
So sooner or later, control engineers will be called to connect them together.

330
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,300
And I think it's fair to say that at the moment, we don't have a theory to connect an event-based

331
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,540
sensors to an event-based actuator.

332
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,660
The way we do it at the moment is that we interface the event-based sensors with a digital

333
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,500
processor.

334
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,400
And then we interface the output of the digital processor, maybe to an event-based actuator.

335
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,020
And that's how we close the loop.

336
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:21,220
But of course, it's very tempting to think that in some specific cases, we could short

337
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:27,500
circuit this interface and go straight from the event-based sensors to the event-based

338
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
actuator.

339
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,780
It makes a lot of sense.

340
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:37,740
Also, I guess, very trivially, potentially, just for energetic considerations.

341
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,540
So all of the systems that you're mentioning are very much energy, what's the opposite

342
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
of energy-hungry?

343
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,700
They would be not very consuming in terms of energy.

344
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Yeah.

345
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:57,180
So this is one advantage that is very often put forward, especially nowadays in the energy

346
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:04,500
crisis that we experience, that event-based is also a potential solution to the carbon

347
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,920
footprint of current technology, and in particular, digital technology.

348
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,560
When I was a student, it was the beginning of the internet, and we really presented digital

349
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,280
technology and digital information as a free technology, as an energy-free technology.

350
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,760
And it's funny that 30 years later, especially after this pandemic, suddenly the carbon footprint

351
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,640
of digital technology is making news.

352
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:42,460
And everyone is sort of becoming very worried about the growing energy demand of the storing,

353
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,400
but not just storage, but all the devices that come with information technology.

354
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,360
And I think that that's exactly the vision of Kaveh Mead.

355
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,280
And Kaveh Mead saw that at the end of the 80s, so long ahead of his time, perhaps because

356
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,640
he was at the very forefront of digital technology, and he could foresee that this Moore's law

357
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,120
that he formulated himself would not go forever, and that there would be a time where we would

358
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,800
be hit by the limitation of digital technology, including the, and prime and foremost, the

359
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,840
energy demand of digital technology.

360
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,640
And I think we are living exactly in that time.

361
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,080
This is a good segue for me to talk about energy.

362
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,360
Energy from a control theoretic perspective.

363
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,040
So very much part of your theoretical investigations is the concept of dissipativity.

364
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,920
And that's one of the pillars of systems theory.

365
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,920
So maybe you can guide us through how does that interwine with the mixed feedback principle,

366
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,720
neuroscience, and your current obsession about monotonicity.

367
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,200
Don't get me started, because it would become a seminar.

368
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:01,760
But yeah, it's true that I think that dissipativity is a central concept of control theory, for

369
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,720
many reasons, but prime and foremost, because it describes this interaction between the

370
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,000
external and internal that I was mentioning earlier, in energetic terms.

371
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,280
So how does the external supply of energy relates to the internal storage of energy?

372
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,840
I think it's a very profound way of describing how a system or how physical systems interacts

373
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,320
with its environment.

374
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,520
It's not the only reason why dissipativity is so important.

375
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,000
I think that, so dissipativity is a bridge, but it's not just a bridge between the external

376
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and the internal.

377
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's also a bridge between mechanics and electricity, because it's also a bridge between

378
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,440
the input-output description of systems and the state-space description of a system.

379
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,640
So it is also a bridge between the heritage of electricity, where we think of circuits

380
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:04,000
as interconnection of input-output devices, and the heritage of mechanics, where we think

381
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,480
of systems as determined by, let's say, Newton's law and governing the motion from an initial

382
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,960
condition.

383
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,440
Dissipativity really interconnects those two worlds, generalizing the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov

384
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,520
lemma, which is perhaps the fundamental heritage of our field.

385
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:32,560
And this bridge is not just a bridge between physics and analysis, between input-output

386
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
and state-space.

387
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:41,040
It is also a bridge between physics and computation, because it is also through that bridge that

388
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,180
linear control theory became algorithmic.

389
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:53,400
It is fascinating that in the dissipativity paper of Ian Williams, the LMI is almost mentioned

390
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:01,280
there en passant, but in fact precedes by 20 years the reformulation of control theory

391
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,640
of every important control theoretic question as the solution of context optimization problem.

392
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,360
So yes, dissipativity is important in many ways.

393
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,440
And then when I moved to mixed feedback, when I moved to neuroscience, I was very frustrated

394
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,600
that somehow I could not use this theory, or I was always hoping for.

395
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:34,160
And I think here, perhaps I have to mention how I came to connect mixed feedback to dissipativity.

396
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,280
And this is thanks to a question from Malcolm Smith, my close colleague.

397
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:47,560
I had given my TED talk in 2014 about mixed feedback and, you know, praising the use of

398
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,160
mixed feedback.

399
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,520
And then I had this conversation with Malcolm and Malcolm said, by the way, how do you define

400
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
negative feedback?

401
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah, you have to, I mean, the value of such questions is, I think that most of my research

402
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,080
comes from such questions that are sometimes asked by colleagues, most of the times asked

403
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,860
by my students, by my postdocs.

404
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,000
It's really through those conversations that you realize that something that you found

405
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,460
evident and self-explanatory, in fact, is not.

406
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,440
And that is pushing you further into digging into the question.

407
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,160
So how do you define?

408
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,280
And the point of Malcolm was that defining what negative feedback is, is what led to

409
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,020
control theory.

410
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:46,120
Because after the invention of the feedback amplifier, very quickly, people start experiencing

411
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,240
instability with negative feedback.

412
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,280
How could possibly negative feedback lead to instability?

413
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,880
Aha, well, this is because the dynamics of the plan can, in fact, change the sign of

414
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,080
the feedback in the loop because of the phase shift.

415
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,720
And this leads to the frequency response and Nyquist.

416
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,880
So the whole heritage of control is in that question somehow.

417
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,740
Now through the question of Malcolm, I realized that there was something missing in connecting

418
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:22,860
mixed feedback to, let's say, dissipativity, because the only way you can define the sign

419
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:29,620
of a feedback loop in a nonlinear system is by thinking incrementally.

420
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,260
So if the feedback signal is a current signal, what determines the sign of the feedback loop

421
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,860
is not whether the current is an inward or outward current.

422
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,940
It is whether the current source has positive conductance or negative conductance.

423
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:53,820
That distinction between the sign of a current and the incremental sign of a current is something

424
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,900
that I didn't appreciate until I started working in that area, until I started discovering

425
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:08,540
how much it is a source of confusion in neuroscience and how much it is a source of confusion in

426
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,780
control.

427
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:18,260
That we, because of the heritage of the linear theory, we always tend to think of incremental

428
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,460
quantities and non-incremental quantities as equivalents, but they are only equivalent

429
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,140
for linear systems.

430
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:33,000
And this is how I started realizing that all what I knew in nonlinear control was rooted

431
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,280
in a non-incremental approach, including dissipativity.

432
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,760
So the dissipativity, the definition of dissipativity of Williams is nonlinear, but it is non-incremental.

433
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:55,000
That is, solutions are always evaluated with respect to the zero storage, the equilibrium

434
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,120
solution that corresponds to the minimal storage.

435
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,600
Instead of evaluating solutions with respect to each other.

436
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,640
And that has indeed become a sort of an obsession to realize that we didn't have an incremental

437
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,880
form of dissipativity theory.

438
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,480
And for many years I tried, and I don't think I'm the only one who tried to explain and

439
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:29,160
understand why we didn't have an incremental form of dissipativity, until I sort of came

440
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,920
up to the conclusion that in fact, we don't have a theory of incremental dissipativity

441
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,720
because we don't have, it's very, very difficult to think of states-based models that have

442
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,560
incremental input-output properties.

443
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,280
That gap is a total surprise to me.

444
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,280
It is very much, it's very close to my current research question.

445
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,600
And again, it is something that independently from neuroscience, independently from the

446
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,240
particular application that led to those questions, I think is a question, is an important question

447
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,720
for the field is how do you define a nonlinear capacitor?

448
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,880
And I've come to the conclusion that the classical state-space definition of a nonlinear capacitor

449
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:24,160
that's, for instance, was advocated by Shua and that is rarely questioned, in fact is

450
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,000
problematic because it gives us a model of a nonlinear integrator that is not incrementally

451
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,440
passive.

452
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:44,080
And this whole path from dissipativity to mixed feedback and sort of back to dissipativity

453
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:53,080
is to me, an example of how research sort of evolves and how ultimately the only way

454
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:02,280
to formulate new questions that can be extremely theoretical and fundamental is always in control

455
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,840
driven by very concrete questions.

456
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:13,800
So I would never have imagined to question the state-space model of a nonlinear capacitor

457
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:20,040
unless I had been pushed to refine what I meant by positive and negative feedback and

458
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,560
how I can sort of encapsulate these concepts that are clear to everyone because they are

459
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,880
everyday concepts, but if you want to turn them into a mathematical theory, you have

460
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,480
to work hard and then you eventually discover that the theory is incomplete.

461
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,680
I think this is the path of research in many problems in control theory.

462
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,680
Again, there is a lot to unpack there.

463
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,960
It was a fantastic journey just to follow your line of thought.

464
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,320
Maybe, OK, the first comment that I have is very curious that at the end of the day, we end up

465
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:06,280
talking so much about a sign change in a sense or whether it's positive feedback or negative

466
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,000
feedback. Another thing that I can extrapolate from line of thought is that, well, I'm going

467
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,560
to quote Sherlock Holmes from Scandal in Bohemia.

468
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,760
He says that it is a capital mistake to theorize that before one has data, insensibly one

469
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,000
begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts.

470
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,080
And this is very much resonating with what you said.

471
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,480
So it seems to me also that, yeah, we are in a situation in control theory at the moment

472
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,680
where we very much see what Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions predicted.

473
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,880
So there are phases in science where there is a growing miscontent with theories that in

474
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,000
some way do not satisfy, they're not able to answer questions that we do have.

475
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,960
And yeah, the last comment I have is that it's quite funny that we always end up talking,

476
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,560
at least in the background, there is always the figure of Jan Willems kind of foreseeing the

477
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,360
importance of so many of these questions, including dissipativity and the tension between

478
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,720
paradigms and puzzles.

479
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,240
So, yeah, that's very true.

480
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,080
And there is a lot in what you just said in a few words.

481
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,840
I agree. And I think that it's not special to our fields.

482
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,120
In fact, perhaps this is the value of venturing in neighboring fields.

483
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,240
So, for instance, I worked for maybe 10 years in optimization and manifolds and was really a

484
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,240
journey outside of my field, I would say, had not much to do with control.

485
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,960
Then I ventured in neuroscience, in neurodynamics, again, in another neighboring

486
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,480
community. And in all those communities, I always observed what you just described.

487
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,680
I think it's inevitable that a topic becomes a topic because it becomes popular.

488
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:07,880
And even if initially it emerged from a very concrete question, maybe after one generation,

489
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:16,160
it becomes a theory that is somehow independent from the question that led to the theory.

490
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,520
And the next generation just works on the theory.

491
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,320
And there is nothing wrong about that because you want to deepen the theory.

492
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,800
The only problem is that this by deepening the theory, you know, you create more expertise

493
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,440
and you create theory that is more and more detached from the original question that

494
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,640
motivated the theory.

495
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,040
And inevitably, eventually, this theory sort of detaches itself from reality.

496
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,040
And and at that time, I think there is indeed the danger that it becomes sort of self

497
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,200
referencing. But as soon as something becomes self referencing, it dies very quickly.

498
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,400
So I think I feel much more in peace with that phenomenon nowadays because I think there

499
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,200
is nothing wrong in that phenomenon.

500
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,680
Perhaps initially I thought, oh, but my field is bad because people are going that way.

501
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,720
I don't think it is specific to my field.

502
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,280
I think it is specific to the mechanism of research.

503
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,480
It just shows the importance of diversity in science.

504
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,200
I think of all my journeys in neighboring disciplines as sort of going into a foreign

505
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,520
country for a while and then going back home.

506
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,920
And to me, it has always been important to come back home because this is where I feel

507
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,840
home. And I think it's important to have a home.

508
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,160
But it's also by traveling that you realize, first of all, that you realize the value of

509
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,600
your own identity.

510
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:57,000
And nowadays, I think I have much higher appreciation for the value of control than I had

511
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,960
before venturing in other fields.

512
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,320
But it also makes you aware of the importance of diversity because it's only by, you

513
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,760
know, venturing and by traveling that you encounter new questions that you and this is

514
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,200
very refreshing. This is very important.

515
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,160
So there is indeed a tension, I think, and we have to be very careful about that tension.

516
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,240
There is no easy answer.

517
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,200
Otherwise, it's part of the cycle of of life in a sense.

518
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,560
Yeah, I mean, it seems almost an evolutionary process in a sense.

519
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,880
So theories do tend, as you say, to evolve on their own.

520
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,680
But at the same time, if they do that too much, they die.

521
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,280
Yeah, I think it's super interesting, potentially like the topic of another podcast

522
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,560
episode. I just want to close the loop maybe on on the, let's say, nonlinear control side of

523
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,120
things, because we didn't touch on, at least in depth, on some of the concepts that I think

524
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:59,160
are key and also made you win, for example, an Axelby Prize recently on the concept of

525
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,440
dissipativity. And maybe they're so and we're talking about the concept of P-dominance

526
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,600
for those who are not familiar with it.

527
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,000
There will be a link in the description and, you know, the concept of contraction, the

528
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,360
concept of positivity and the concept of monotonicity.

529
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,280
So how do all of these notions interwine and why are they so fundamental in a way?

530
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:31,640
OK, again, there is danger that I start a seminar here, but at the core of all these

531
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,640
questions is, again, the difference between incremental and non-incremental.

532
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,280
And I think it's best to start with the concept that is perhaps the most common concept to

533
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,720
every control theory, the concept of stability, and even more so the concept of Lyapunov

534
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,640
stability, which is a concept of internal stability, so state-space concept.

535
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,760
Lyapunov stability is non-incremental, it is stability with respect to an equilibrium

536
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,640
solution. The non-incremental, the incremental form of Lyapunov stability is

537
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:18,320
contraction. And contraction was introduced in our field in 98, this paper of Slotin and

538
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:26,000
Lou Miller, that I think is a turning point in our appreciation of incremental properties

539
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,280
in the state-space domain.

540
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:37,520
And we see nowadays, 15 years, 25 years after this, the publication of this paper, that

541
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,480
indeed contraction has become widely appreciated.

542
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:49,120
And I think that there is a wide appreciation of why contraction is important and perhaps

543
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,120
more important in many engineering questions than Lyapunov stability.

544
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,680
But contraction is just an incremental form, in my thinking, is just an incremental form of

545
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Lyapunov stability.

546
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,800
Now, this is all about an internal concept of stability or a state-space concept.

547
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,480
What about the input-output concepts?

548
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,840
Input-output stability is well understood in the linear case.

549
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,880
In the non-linear case, the incremental form of input-output stability is an incremental

550
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,920
gain. And there is some theory about incremental L2 gains.

551
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,800
But a big missing bit of the control theory today is the lack of concept of incremental

552
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,320
passivity. That brings us back to the question I was alluding to earlier.

553
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,080
Why don't we have an incremental form of dissipativity?

554
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,280
And so the notion of incremental passivity is very well understood in an input-output

555
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,440
setting. If you go back to the early work of the textbooks of de Zuhr and Vidya Sagar, for

556
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,080
instance, passivity and incremental passivity are treated on equal foot, I would say.

557
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:10,440
But in my education, which is post-input-output theory, which is very much state-space

558
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:17,880
theory, because from the 80s, non-linear control became dominated by state-space

559
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,760
modelling approaches.

560
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,120
The incremental concept is pretty much absent of any textbooks of non-linear control.

561
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,160
So non-linear control theory is very much a non-incremental theory nowadays.

562
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,120
And I think it's because of the state-space model concept.

563
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:41,000
So my effort in revisiting incremental passivity, and that is what led me to this notion

564
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,800
of monotonicity. What is monotonicity?

565
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
It's incremental positivity.

566
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,800
So we have what are the notions of positivity?

567
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,080
Or we have many notions of positivity, because when we go from scalar to vectors and then

568
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,160
we go from vectors to operators, well, there are many ways to generalise the concept of

569
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,120
positivity. Passivity is one concept of positivity out of many.

570
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:14,200
And monotonicity as the incremental form of passivity is one concept of monotonicity

571
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,240
among others.

572
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:22,200
It's an input-output concept of monotonicity that I've discovered by going back to the

573
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,040
early days of circuit theory and by discovering that the person who invented the concept of

574
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:36,320
monotonicity, Minty in 1960, was precisely trying to answer a question that I've had to

575
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,560
answer for the last 10 years.

576
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,320
What is a non-linear resistor?

577
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,400
How do you define an element with positive conductance?

578
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:50,360
Here we go. That's also the value of re-studying history from time to time is that very,

579
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,920
very often you discover the answer to your questions.

580
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,560
You discover that they have been previously answered, but then they have been forgotten.

581
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,120
And so I became very interested in the input-output concept of monotonicity invented by

582
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,400
Minty, the fact that it then became a sort of foundation of convex optimisation.

583
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,600
So again, this bridge between physical modelling and computation is very much there and it

584
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,520
is there in the incremental form of passivity.

585
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,080
It is not there in the non-incremental form of passivity, which was the topic of my first

586
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:36,080
book, so of my early days in control, using passivity as a fundamental concept to, let's

587
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,320
say, solve stabilisation questions.

588
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,760
But the non-linear passivity concept, the non-incremental form of passivity, is a very

589
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,800
nice concept, of course, because it retains a physical meaning, but it's not an algorithmic

590
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,200
concept for sure.

591
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,360
And so the fact that a negative conductance, so a resistance with negative conductance

592
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:10,440
could be a passive element, started really showing the value of clarifying the incremental

593
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,120
properties of a device and not just the non-incremental passivity property of a device.

594
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,520
Sorry if it is too long of an answer to your question, but it's never too long, never.

595
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,040
I guess when you refer to conductance, you mean differential conductance or incremental

596
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,800
conductance. That's what you conceptually visualise.

597
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,800
Because I think that conductance should be understood only differentially.

598
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,480
The notion of chordal conductance or non-incremental conductance is not really

599
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,000
meaningful. Monotonicity means that the slope of your function is always positive.

600
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:52,120
But what is the meaning of positivity with respect to zero, that the graph of your function

601
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,160
lies in the first and third quadrants?

602
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,040
Yes, it is a property, but it's a property that has nothing to do with monotonicity.

603
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,000
And I think one would agree that for most problems, the property of monotonicity would be

604
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,600
far more important than the property of positivity, of non-incremental positivity.

605
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,480
I hear a lot of, let's say, resonance with one of your latest editorials on the IEEE

606
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,120
controlled magazines systems.

607
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,640
I should mention that Rodolf is the editor-in-chief of that journal.

608
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,560
I'll put a link in the description to the journal and the editorials.

609
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,960
The last one at this stage is about the art of the state.

610
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:42,600
And it's really a campaign to almost overthrow the state space modelling in favour of

611
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,520
something that is more tractable and something that is also, I would say, more robust for

612
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,800
the purpose of algorithmic computation.

613
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,320
Is that fair to say, you think?

614
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,520
I'm always sorry when I hear that I'm campaigning against something because it is

615
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,600
certainly not my intention to campaign against state space modelling.

616
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:11,680
To me, the value of control is precisely in bridging the state space world of mechanics

617
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,280
and the input-output world of electricity.

618
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,040
So my campaign is for that bridge.

619
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,120
It's not that we should be one-sided.

620
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,640
And it is for that bridge because my view of control theory or for non-linear control

621
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,400
theory is that today that it's very much dominated by state space, so it's very much

622
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,400
one-sided.

623
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,920
And it's not an accident that every application of non-linear control nowadays is in,

624
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:47,360
well, I should say nearly, almost application is in robotics rather than in electronics.

625
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,960
In fact, the contact between control and circuits disappeared in the non-linear age.

626
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,600
So if you open a textbook on non-linear control, there is very, very little about non-linear

627
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,080
circuits. And if you open a textbook about non-linear circuits, there is very, very little

628
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:14,120
about control. And my efforts to model neural systems as non-linear circuits has pushed

629
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:21,680
me to study and learn the old theory that was developed in the 70s that was all coming

630
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,880
from circuit theory and aiming at developing a non-linear feedback system theory inspired

631
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
by circuit theory.

632
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,200
And so if I'm campaigning for something, it's only to restore the importance of this

633
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,000
input-output approach and the value of the bridge between the input-output approach and

634
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,680
the state space approach. It's not at all against the, I mean, of course, the concept of

635
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:52,000
state space is extraordinarily important and a very, very important heritage of our

636
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
field.

637
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,080
Yeah, so I guess it would be more fair to say that you're campaigning to resurrect the

638
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,680
bridge that once upon a time was so evident and perhaps these days is not so much.

639
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
Yes.

640
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,360
I guess, again, here, from here, we could take many directions.

641
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,560
I have a couple of questions that I do want to ask you about, let's say, the implications

642
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,600
of your research in neuroscience before maybe we move on and touch on other topics.

643
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,240
Some of these are maybe a bit provocative and they're like the aim at fantasizing, if

644
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,720
you want, about what can we achieve if we understand the mechanisms by which neurons

645
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,840
or even the brain work?

646
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:38,520
So the question broadly would be really, what can we achieve, say, in the next decade, 20

647
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,240
years, 100 years, if we push forward this concept?

648
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,120
And, for example, I don't know, what can we say about perception?

649
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,960
How is it integrated or is there any hope about saying something about how consciousness

650
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
arises?

651
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:01,680
I'm not a neuroscientist, and so I don't think I'm qualified to make any prediction about

652
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,920
the future of neuroscience.

653
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:10,800
What I see through my colleagues who are neuroscientists is that there also there is a

654
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,280
resurrection of the cybernetics age.

655
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,640
So the whole effort of cybernetics was to think of the brain as a machine and to approach

656
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,720
the brain. So the British father of cybernetics, Ross Ashby, was not a control theorist, was

657
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,640
not an engineer. He was a psychiatrist.

658
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,520
And it was part of this.

659
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:37,160
It was very much at the genesis of cybernetics to approach the understanding of the brain

660
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,360
from an engineering perspective.

661
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,520
And then with the rise of molecular biology, neuroscience became a quantitative science

662
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:55,080
and it became very much dominated by a very scientific approach of describing the brain,

663
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,440
describing the anatomy of the brain, describing the anatomy of the neural circuits and

664
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,200
understanding the neural circuits from those scientific descriptions.

665
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,360
We see an illustration of that fact with, for instance, the emphasis nowadays on

666
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:16,840
connectomics, that, you know, as if understanding the connectome of a large network would

667
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,640
tell you how the network works.

668
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:26,680
And I think that nowadays there is more and more appreciation in neuroscience that if

669
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,040
we want to think of if we want to make progress in understanding the brain, it's not

670
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,480
enough to have this scientific description of the brain.

671
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,240
We need also to understand the mechanism of the brain.

672
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,000
And it's very valuable to approach those mechanisms from an engineering perspective.

673
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:51,560
And again, there is always a balance in neuroscience and in every science between science

674
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:57,840
and engineering. So in neuroscience, you have a balance between the quest of understanding

675
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,920
the brain and the medical desire of curing diseases.

676
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,760
OK, and there is a tension between those two.

677
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:12,560
But I think that the value of it's also that I love this claim of Feynman, who is

678
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,880
perhaps the most theoretical physicist of our time, but saying understanding is building.

679
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,120
So the idea that it is by building a machine that mimics the brain that we will

680
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,520
understand the brain.

681
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,480
I quite like that view and that approach.

682
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,920
And so that is closer to my field because control is about design.

683
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,440
And to me, control is design under uncertainty.

684
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,520
I think this is a concept that resonates very much with the current approach of thinking

685
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:54,360
of brain as producing extremely reliable functions out of huge uncertainty and

686
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,000
sloppiness in the components.

687
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:02,360
So how much so much variability in the anatomical components of the brain can lead to

688
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,680
such reliable brain functions?

689
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,880
I think that's a core question of neuroscience today.

690
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,760
That's why I think it's a control question.

691
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,920
And I think that as a control theorist, I see this as a key question for the future of

692
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,120
artificial intelligence and the future of robotics.

693
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:25,360
How can we design intelligence machines, so machines that are closer to what we

694
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,400
experience in natural intelligence and deal with the uncertainty and deal with the

695
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,680
sloppiness of the components?

696
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,720
And I expect a lot of progress and a lot of synergy and interaction between

697
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,320
neuroscience and control engineering along those lines.

698
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,800
So maybe we're going to cut this later.

699
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,600
So you mentioned at the outset.

700
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,240
So we're looking forward to seeing the relationship between control and neuroscience

701
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,760
condensing in your upcoming book with Guillaume Drion and Alessio Franchi, whose title

702
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,280
is, if I remember correctly, Neuromorphic Controlled Principles.

703
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,840
Is that right?

704
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,840
And we're looking forward to that.

705
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,400
Yeah.

706
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,200
You know, there are many, many books out there that are half written.

707
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:17,240
So we will see whether this book belongs to the category of published or never published

708
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,960
book. But no, no, I do think that this book will.

709
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,040
There are two reasons why you can write a book.

710
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,840
You either write a book because you want to learn a topic or you write a book because you

711
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,040
are an expert on the topic.

712
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:34,600
I like very much, I think it's Vidya Sagar who once told me that if you want to learn

713
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,520
about a topic, write a book on that topic.

714
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,280
There is no better way of learning than being forced to explaining concepts.

715
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,360
And again, we go back here to the tension again between teaching and researching, which is

716
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,240
very much intertwined, I would say.

717
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,280
I guess this is a good time to shift gears a little bit.

718
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,200
And I mean, there is a number of questions that I like to ask to our guests.

719
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,480
But first, I would like to maybe dig into, I would say, something like that I would call a

720
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,040
double life almost that you lived.

721
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,680
So you had time to explore optimization on manifolds in a book that potentially I think

722
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,360
it's your most cited publication so far.

723
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,160
And I remember having a conversation with you where essentially you told me that it

724
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,960
started as a hobby, almost it started as something that a side project, is that fair to

725
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,960
say? I wouldn't say a side project, but I would say as a sort of, yeah, as a journey.

726
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,600
So it is a side project, as you would decide to visit a country for a while and then come

727
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:42,320
back. And perhaps it's the first time in my career where I sort of venture into a

728
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:49,680
neighboring discipline because, yes, control is very much a science of optimization and a

729
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,800
science of feedback.

730
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,680
But I think that optimization is not specific to controls.

731
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:00,240
Optimization is somehow a driving paradigm in many disciplines.

732
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:06,000
So also having ventured in optimization for a while and having come back to control, I now

733
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,080
consider that out of the two, feedback is really what is the distinctive feature of

734
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:19,760
control theory and that control theory exists as what it is because it addresses it.

735
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,840
I think it's the only science in my view that really addressed the question of feedback at

736
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:31,680
its core. So venturing in neighboring disciplines showed me the value of traveling and

737
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,600
traveling abroad and learning another language and also appreciating how difficult it is

738
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,840
and how time consuming it is to learn the language of another community.

739
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,360
I used that skill later on when I decided to venture in neuroscience.

740
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,960
So it was sort of a first step.

741
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:57,600
And then perhaps realizing that by moving to neighboring disciplines, you can potentially

742
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,400
contribute to the discipline in a very original way.

743
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:09,160
Not necessarily being more clever than your peers, but having these different insights that

744
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,760
comes from the diversity I was talking before.

745
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:19,480
And so, of course, I'm very glad of the success of optimization on manifolds a posteriori

746
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,520
because it was totally unexpected.

747
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,120
And clearly working on that topic in the early 2000s was working on a very esoteric topic.

748
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:34,560
And seeing that now this topic has become widespread in machine learning and computer

749
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:41,880
vision and is, of course, very rewarding and to me, encouraging about the value of

750
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:47,920
diversity, about the value of jumping in a neighboring community and saying, OK, this is

751
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,160
what matters in my field.

752
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,800
Do you think it might be of relevance in your field as well?

753
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,000
And in that case, it was the role of invariance.

754
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,680
You know, we put a lot of attention to invariance properties when we do physical

755
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,680
modeling in control and the geometric thinking in control is very much rooted in an

756
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,960
effort to formulate questions in a sort of coordinate free manner.

757
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:21,080
And so in ways that are invariant as much as possible and approaching the design of

758
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:27,720
optimization algorithms with this particular angle was not common at all, certainly at the

759
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:33,800
time. And of course, it's of great relevance in a number of engineering disciplines where

760
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,920
let's say you want to computer vision algorithms to be invariance to the motion of the

761
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,280
camera or things like that.

762
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,840
We can think of many problems where invariance are of tremendous importance.

763
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:53,720
And yeah, to me, it was that's what I learned from my journey in optimization, that by

764
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,880
venturing in a neighboring field, well, first of all, it is very challenging because you

765
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,240
have to learn a new language.

766
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:06,040
Second of all, perhaps the way you can contribute there is by using your own identity and

767
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,440
using the diversity that you are bringing in a different community.

768
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:18,760
And so I became sort of more confident that indeed diversity is something very rewarding in

769
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,720
science and very important in science.

770
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,240
Again, there's a lot of meat to unpack there.

771
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,440
You're indirectly addressing one of the questions that I would have asked you before,

772
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,120
actually later about advice to future students, potentially.

773
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:39,560
Another thing that you touched on that I think is important is the relevance of

774
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:44,800
conceptualizing almost in a representation free manner, if that makes sense.

775
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:51,560
So that is something that is very much at the core of much of the research of Jan Willems in

776
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,480
the field of systems theory.

777
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,600
So this is actually one of the questions that I wanted to ask you.

778
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,200
And maybe then I'll try to close the loop on optimization of manifold.

779
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,880
But would it be fair to say that he was one of the most inspiring figures for you?

780
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,080
And if you had to name three, who would they be?

781
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,120
I know it's a tough question and it will definitely be do injustice to some.

782
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,560
Yeah, well.

783
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:20,800
There is no question that Jan Willems would be one of the three and that I think it is his

784
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:28,320
research that has been perhaps most influential on my research in exactly what you were

785
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:36,240
saying in the importance of questions and the importance of formulating a question in a

786
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,600
mathematically precise.

787
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:44,240
So this tension about picking your questions out of conceptual questions, like what is

788
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,720
positive feedback? It's a very conceptual question.

789
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:53,200
But then turning that conceptual questions into something that becomes mathematically

790
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,840
precise. I think that the research of Jan Willems in that regard is really remarkable.

791
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:05,560
And I have no doubt that it will be a longstanding heritage for the field for that reason.

792
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:12,760
If I have to think of other names, well, clearly I would mention my mentor, who is Peter

793
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,920
Kokotowicz. And Peter Kokotowicz influenced me in a very different way than Jan Willems.

794
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,360
It's not so much the research, I think, that influenced me, but the attitudes towards

795
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:29,960
research. And probably that today, when I have to make a decision about what to do, what not

796
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:36,040
to do, how to do something, the person that most frequently comes to mind is Peter

797
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,600
Kokotowicz. So what would have he done in this situation?

798
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,480
What would have been his advice?

799
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,480
And it is in that sense that I consider him as my mentor.

800
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,120
He certainly taught me the value of history and the fact that you cannot understand the

801
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,120
concept until you have unfolded the history of that concept.

802
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,720
I find this extremely important.

803
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,600
In science, we often have a negative vision on history, on the whole of history.

804
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,680
Oh, history is looking backwards.

805
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,520
Science should look forward.

806
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:16,160
And, yeah, I do think that the best way to look forward is first to look in the past

807
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:22,680
what is useful to move forward and take heritage of what was known in the past.

808
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,360
A third name, I'm afraid would not be a name, but I would like to mention here really the

809
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,880
role of my students and postdocs, including you, Alberto, because I think that and I

810
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,800
mentioned that earlier, that in those conversations that make you realize that you

811
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:46,560
didn't formulate clearly what you thought you were formulating clearly, those

812
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,680
conversations are the motor of my research.

813
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,600
And those conversations can, of course, happen with colleagues and with anyone.

814
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,840
But nothing replaces the role of students and postdocs in my experience in that

815
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:05,480
journey. So because with a postdoc or with a PhD student, you develop a sort of a

816
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,560
relationship over a number of years.

817
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,200
And so this conversation over time becomes very intimate.

818
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:20,280
And really pushes you to the heart of the matter in a way that is unmatched, I think.

819
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:27,240
So, again, the value of teaching and mentoring as the motor of research, it is

820
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,600
something that is very much part of my identity, I think.

821
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,040
That's fantastic.

822
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,120
Again, you keep on serving me assists about how to proceed forward, and it's always

823
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,920
difficult to choose because there's so many avenues that are interesting.

824
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,280
So I mentioned earlier that I wanted to close the loop with optimization of manifolds.

825
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,840
And we mentioned the value of history as well.

826
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,680
So I think this is a good time to ask the question of pondering about the past, the

827
01:08:54,680 --> 01:09:01,080
present and the future of our field and of the fields you ventured into, if you have

828
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,240
any thoughts.

829
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,520
So I guess the question could be phrased as what are you most excited about in the years

830
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,680
to come? What are the technologies that we should look for?

831
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:16,040
And yeah, what are the questions maybe that systems and control theory should address?

832
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:22,680
OK, I think that it's probably clear from what I discussed before, I'm very excited by

833
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,600
the role of cybernetics right after the Second World War.

834
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:34,240
I'm very puzzled by the fact that this period was so short lived and that somehow the

835
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:40,080
publication of the book Cybernetics was the end of the cybernetics age because of

836
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,960
information theory and because of the invention of the computer that put an end somehow to

837
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:51,640
the needs of thinking of machines and animals in the same framework.

838
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,960
I think we are returning to the cybernetics questions and I think that this will occupy a

839
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:03,280
lot of researchers, not just in control, but also in control in the future.

840
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,680
I think that we have reached a stage where we see the limitations of machine learning.

841
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,800
We have reached a stage where we see the limitations of digital technology and we see

842
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:22,120
that the limitations of those two extremely successful developments of the second half of

843
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:29,880
the 20th century, that the limitations of those technologies come from the uncertainty

844
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,960
and come from the difficulty of handling and coping with uncertainty.

845
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,520
So this is a perfect age for control.

846
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:46,400
And I think that control will have, in my view, control has a very glorious future ahead.

847
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,280
First of all, because it's a very young science.

848
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:56,000
I keep thinking that control became science after the Second World War.

849
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,400
So it's very recently.

850
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,280
And that success of control is really designed under uncertainty, as I've said before.

851
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:09,640
And we have no shortage of engineering and technological challenges where we have to cope

852
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,520
with uncertainty.

853
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,760
But of course, we have to pay attention to what is happening and we have to pay attention to

854
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,160
how we can contribute to what is happening.

855
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,680
And in that regard, I have come to regard the question of feedback as really the core

856
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,240
question of control theory.

857
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,440
And I think that nowadays, perhaps a lot of research in our community has moved away from

858
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:39,000
the core question of feedback, has also perhaps moved away from the question of uncertainty

859
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,320
because of the prevalence of optimisation and machine learning and the fascination of what

860
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,040
you can do with the digital computation.

861
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,080
And again, don't take me wrong.

862
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:57,400
It's not that I would want to campaign against that, but it is that I think that the future

863
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:05,280
of control is in identifying that the way we can contribute to this field and to engineering

864
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:12,520
in general is really by our unique way of approaching the question of uncertainty and how

865
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:19,760
we cope with uncertainty and how we can, thanks to feedback, turn very uncertain devices

866
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,120
into certain functions.

867
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:29,200
This is a very fascinating picture of the future in a way, which, again, keeps on serving me

868
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,080
answers about questions that I have for you.

869
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,640
And one that I tend to ask to every guest here is about advice to future generations.

870
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:43,920
So if the question could be phrased as like, what are the most important traits that

871
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,560
successful researcher in our field should have?

872
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:53,400
Or is there anything that you wish you knew something about, say, when you started your

873
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,080
career? What sort of advice could you give to future students in control?

874
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,080
It's a very open ended question and it could be also like, what should they invest on, for

875
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:03,560
example?

876
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:10,240
Right. Perhaps what I would answer, it's not so much the what that matters, but the how

877
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
and the why.

878
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:22,120
And so I think you can, at least for a long, even in the PhD, there is this tension between

879
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,280
research and education.

880
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:31,400
You do a PhD, I often tell my students, maybe I told you that before, what I learned in

881
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,080
my PhD is how not to do research.

882
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,360
And perhaps this is the most important skill that you need to develop at an early stage

883
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:46,080
of your career, because everyone starts research with the ambition of, you know, solving

884
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,920
new questions, identifying the important questions.

885
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:57,000
And but what you learn by doing research is that the difficulty is not to find difficult

886
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
questions. There are plenty.

887
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,480
The difficulty is to respond.

888
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:09,280
The difficulty is to resonate with a question of your time and to develop skills that

889
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:16,520
eventually will give you a competitive advantage or a unique angle of attack to address

890
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,920
some questions. And that happens, again, as in the same way as I was talking about the

891
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,720
trajectory, that happens through a sequence of events.

892
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,720
And I think that the events themselves are not that important.

893
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,560
It's really that you have to learn how you respond to events and you have to find your

894
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,080
own identity in the way you respond to events.

895
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,720
And, yeah, of course, ultimately, the advice comes from Socrata, Knotis Eotan, once if

896
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,480
you know yourself, if you know your limitation, if you know what you can do well, you will

897
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:54,520
do well. And perhaps that's that's the most important question that we need to learn at

898
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,400
an early stage of our career is to try to learn something about ourselves.

899
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:07,480
Maybe the last question I have before closing this episode relates to something that I am

900
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,160
thinking about a lot these days, and that's the concept of creativity.

901
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,200
I think you're one of the most creative persons I've met so far in my life.

902
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,520
And so I have a question for you.

903
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,120
I mean, I'll start with maybe a quote from David Bohm.

904
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:29,480
David Bohm is writing the following in wholeness and the implicate order.

905
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:34,800
He writes, one prerequisite of originality is clearly that a person shall not be inclined

906
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,120
to impose his preconceptions on the fact as he sees it.

907
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,680
Rather, he must be able to learn something new, even if it means that the ideas and the

908
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,920
notions that are comfortable or dear to him may be overturned.

909
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,000
And this is something that seems to very much resonate with what you were mentioning

910
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,320
before. So I guess the question would be here.

911
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,680
Is there anything, any sort of advice that you can give to generate creativity?

912
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:06,560
Well, you are very generous, and I'm not sure I would identify myself as someone

913
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:13,000
particularly creative, but I love this quote of Daniel Barenboim, who is a great

914
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,760
pianist, and he says music teaches us the difference between freedom and anarchy.

915
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:25,520
And I think that scientific creativity, very much like creativity in art, is a very

916
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,680
fine balance between constraints and imagination.

917
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:36,800
And it seems to me, but perhaps this is personal, that it is the most constrained

918
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,560
type of art that leads to the biggest creativity.

919
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,720
So, for instance, I don't think there is a stronger illustration of that than the

920
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:52,760
music of Bach. The music of Bach is almost mathematical in a way, in the sense that it

921
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,560
obeys such strict rules.

922
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:03,360
How comes that throughout centuries it generates so much emotion, including in

923
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:08,520
people who have no musical education, who don't know about the constraints?

924
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:15,000
And I think that in our field, again, we are back to the fact that control is at the

925
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,400
same time a very mathematical science, but a science of something very concrete.

926
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,800
So I think that the best creativity that I see in control is the one very much

927
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,480
constrained by mathematics and by the rules of mathematics.

928
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:37,720
And how you find a place for novel, for innovation in those rules is a bit of a

929
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:43,080
mystery. And this is where the concreteness of the environment plays its role.

930
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:51,120
So the pianist who creates emotion from a piece of Bach might create emotion today and

931
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,640
totally fail tomorrow.

932
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:58,400
He might create emotion in you today, not in me and tomorrow in me and not in you.

933
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:04,560
So it's always about, and I think pianists would tell us that it's about a resonance

934
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,600
with the public. This resonance is really two sided.

935
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,560
It's not one side.

936
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,640
So you don't have entire control on it.

937
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,720
But you are the one who know the constraints, who have to operate under the

938
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:22,080
constraints. And somehow by acknowledging that those constraints are a prerequisite

939
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:29,120
for emotion and for that will happen in a somewhat uncontrolled way.

940
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,560
Perhaps I would think that this is a very important, at least part of creativity.

941
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,280
So creativity is much more than that.

942
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:43,240
But it is an element of creativity that has always fascinated me because I find that

943
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,400
research in control is very constrained.

944
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,240
You know, sorry to again talk about feedback.

945
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:57,720
I cannot help. But constraining a concept like feedback with mathematics seems like

946
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,400
you are. Why do you do that?

947
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:06,840
What is the value of constraining such a beautiful concept with the rules of logics?

948
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,920
And that is exactly the mystery of science and art.

949
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,880
I think that it is because the concept is not enough.

950
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,080
It is the communication of the concept that is as important as the concept.

951
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,760
And the communication uses those constraints.

952
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,360
So communication in science uses mathematics as a channel.

953
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:41,480
And this channel is indispensable to communicate and to exchange about the concept of

954
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,920
feedback that creates emotion in you and me.

955
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,760
But definitely a different one in you and different in me.

956
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:55,600
And if we don't have this mathematical language, we never know whether what we express

957
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:03,720
about the concept is indeed resonating with what your interlocutor thinks of the

958
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,000
concept. Sorry if this is too long of an answer.

959
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,480
It's absolutely not. I mean, it's very much resonating with, I guess, with Galileo.

960
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,120
So the world is written in the language of the universe is mathematics.

961
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,880
Since we're talking about creativity, I mean, there is abundant evidence that shows that

962
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,000
one thing that seems to stimulate creativity is walking.

963
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,400
And I know you're an incredibly avid hiker.

964
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:35,520
So in closing the episode, I thought it would be nice to ask you what is on your to-do list

965
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,080
there? Like, is there anything that you have planned?

966
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,720
Well, there the list is too long to be closed in one lifetime.

967
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,680
So I hope my legs can bring me to a lot of new paths.

968
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:54,520
I must say that and perhaps this has been a consequence of the pandemics that I've

969
01:20:54,520 --> 01:21:00,640
discovered that walking 10 miles from home can create the same emotion as walking on

970
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,760
the other side of the planet.

971
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:11,040
So maybe, you know, when I was younger, my to-do list includes a very famous treks and

972
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,280
very challenging ones.

973
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:19,680
But I've come to appreciate that it is the activity of walking that is wonderful and

974
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:25,120
that very often and certainly in my case, I'm lucky that I don't have to walk very far

975
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,840
from home to find wonderful landscapes and to enjoy walking.

976
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:38,280
So I hope I will walk as much as possible and in the future and for as long as

977
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:43,560
possible. But I don't care too much where I will walk, to be honest.

978
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:50,720
But definitely, I agree that there is something quite fascinating about walking, also

979
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,760
for a control engineer, because we try to build walking machines.

980
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:04,400
And I also wrote an editorial about rhythm recently and rhythm are definitely a very,

981
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,160
very important aspect of animal machines.

982
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,680
And walking is a very important activity.

983
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:16,040
And I recently heard a very, very interesting conversation on the team of walking

984
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,080
between philosopher and a neurophysiologist.

985
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,600
And so the question was, is walking thinking or is thinking walking?

986
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:30,600
That resonates a lot with me as well, that certainly most of my thinking is while

987
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,480
walking in my personal experience.

988
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,520
But it is also a fact, and this was the point of the neurologist, that in fact, the more

989
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,960
we study the brain, the more we tend to think of the activity of thinking very much as

990
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:51,360
we think of the activity of walking and of, in fact, any other rhythmic activity of the

991
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:58,360
body. So the rhythmic nature of thinking, I think, is of great importance and again, a

992
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,480
natural place for control.

993
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,160
Yeah, so again, this is super fascinating in what we just mentioned is very much

994
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,680
resonating with one of your latest editorials, Clocks and Rhythms, again on IEEE

995
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,840
Control Magazine. There will be a link in the description.

996
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,760
Unfortunately, we are at the end of our episode.

997
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,800
It's been a wonderful journey, Rodolf.
