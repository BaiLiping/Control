Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

00:10.440 --> 00:23.440
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.040
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.200
Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Centre of Competence in Research on Dependable Ubiquitous

00:31.200 --> 00:36.360
Automation, as well as the International Federation of Automatic Control.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.360
Our guest today is Rodolf Sapulka, from the University of Cambridge, is Professor of Engineering

00:41.360 --> 00:43.160
in the Control Group.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.840
Welcome to the show, Rodolf.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
Thank you.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.840
And good morning, Alberto.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.120
So I should probably give a small disclaimer that I've been spending a lot of time with

00:52.120 --> 00:54.960
Rodolf over three years in Cambridge.

00:54.960 --> 01:01.320
Some time ago in my past, it's been a pleasure to do so and so it will be potentially a semi

01:01.320 --> 01:06.440
different episode in the sense that I know you better than other people.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.440
And so having spent quite some time together, I know you are an avid reader and an avid

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
hiker.

01:12.440 --> 01:17.880
So I guess just to break the ice, I'm curious about knowing what is on your reading list

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
at the moment.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.880
Wow.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.880
A very unexpected question.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.880
There are always many things on the reading list.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.960
But actually, there is nothing on the reading list right at the minute, strangely enough.

01:33.960 --> 01:39.680
And often the best novels that I've read, I discovered them by complete accident, for

01:39.680 --> 01:43.040
instance, in the bookstore of an airport.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.360
And so I'm always, I like to be surprised.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.400
And sometimes this leads to the best reads.

01:51.920 --> 01:52.920
I'm curious.

01:52.920 --> 01:59.680
So, OK, one quote, one from one of your favorite readers is Oran Pamuk, a Nobel Prize in Literature

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
in 2006.

02:00.680 --> 02:06.660
So he said in The New Life, I read a book one day and my whole life was changed.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.720
So if that were to be the book, which one would it be for you?

02:10.720 --> 02:11.720
Which book?

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Yes.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
That changed my life.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Yeah.

02:14.720 --> 02:22.800
I don't think I could single out one book also because books, yeah, maybe it will be

02:22.800 --> 02:25.000
a strange answer to your question.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.560
But as a teenager, I was totally fascinated by Dostoyevsky.

02:32.560 --> 02:39.200
And then there was a strange event that occurred to me when I was around 40.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.960
And one day I picked a book of Dostoyevsky and I said, let's go back to it.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.680
And I stopped after three pages.

02:47.680 --> 02:54.880
And I realized at that time that the emotion that you can experience while reading a book

02:54.880 --> 03:02.360
is extremely dependent on your age, your environment, your stage in life.

03:02.360 --> 03:09.400
And so I think that it's not that certain books are objectively monuments.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.600
Of course they are.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.860
But I think it's always a story of resonance.

03:14.860 --> 03:22.040
And so it's a resonance at a particular time for a special reason between the reader and

03:22.040 --> 03:23.240
the writer.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.720
That's how I would describe my experience with books.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.960
I actually love this answer because it kind of adds a dynamic element to a book.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.800
It's not something that is there forever, but it really has to be a synergy between

03:37.800 --> 03:39.760
the reader and the book itself.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.080
It's always an encounter.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.080
Yes.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.760
Very fascinating.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.040
So since you mentioned you being a teenager, I like to always draw a sort of picture of

03:49.040 --> 03:50.800
your trajectory as a human.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.800
Yeah.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.360
So I'm curious about what brought you to control.

03:54.360 --> 04:00.120
So like, what is it about, say, your environment or your childhood or anything that you can

04:00.120 --> 04:03.080
think of that brought you to control?

04:03.080 --> 04:04.760
That's very hard to answer.

04:04.760 --> 04:08.240
Again, I don't have a very clear answer.

04:08.240 --> 04:15.360
I can pinpoint events that eventually brought me where I am.

04:15.360 --> 04:21.200
And so one event that perhaps I could tell about what led me to control, even though

04:21.280 --> 04:27.280
it has nothing to do with control, is that it was my second year of engineering.

04:27.280 --> 04:32.600
And it was the course of thermodynamics, which was definitely not my favorite subject at

04:32.600 --> 04:33.600
the time.

04:33.600 --> 04:40.320
But I remember very vividly that the professor once entered the classroom and was nearly

04:40.320 --> 04:47.320
shooting at us and saying, have you heard of what has just been reported that for the

04:47.320 --> 04:55.640
first time ever, one has observed superconductivity above 30 degrees Kelvin.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.760
And that experiments will change the world.

04:58.760 --> 05:04.360
And he went on and for the best part of the lecture, he just told us about these experiments

05:04.360 --> 05:08.280
and why it was fascinating and what would be the consequence of it.

05:08.280 --> 05:15.480
And I don't remember anything of what he told, but I do remember his eyes.

05:15.480 --> 05:21.280
And I do remember the light and I would say the fire during that lecture.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.080
And perhaps it is the moment in my life where I sort of experienced for the first time that

05:27.080 --> 05:31.900
there is such an intimate connection between teaching and research.

05:31.900 --> 05:38.760
And I would say that today I would pinpoint that event as something that led me to my

05:38.760 --> 05:44.840
profession, even though I'm sure that at the time, you know, it was just a complete accident.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.200
Perhaps this professor doesn't remember that he told those stories.

05:48.200 --> 05:54.000
Again, it is a sort of a resonance that is completely accidental.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.200
And I think of any trajectory as somehow interpolating between those events.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.120
And those events are always independent of you.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.120
They are very accidental.

06:08.120 --> 06:15.920
So you could wonder whether how an identity can be defined by such stochastic events.

06:15.920 --> 06:23.080
But at the same time, I like to think that where I am today is not that dependent on

06:23.080 --> 06:27.840
those events and that perhaps a completely different sequence of events would have led

06:27.840 --> 06:32.640
to a trajectory that would not be so different.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.640
And to me, this is a mystery of life.

06:34.640 --> 06:42.120
The fact that we are so much determined by accidental events.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.640
And at the same time, our own identity is not so much in these events, but how we respond

06:46.640 --> 06:48.000
to those events.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.040
And maybe this is my fascination for control theory, because after all, control theory

06:55.040 --> 07:01.040
is a science where you study the interaction between the external and the internal.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.160
We study how systems respond to disturbances.

07:05.160 --> 07:10.440
I find this quite deep and central to engineering, actually.

07:10.440 --> 07:15.160
And decision making is the only lever that you can pull somehow.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.800
I mean, it's definitely fascinating.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.560
I guess the only comment I have is that in a sense, one cannot repeat the experiment

07:22.560 --> 07:24.520
as to the best of our knowledge.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.520
Absolutely.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.280
So we don't know who we would be with another sequence of events.

07:32.280 --> 07:38.720
But this is not something that causes me any anxiety, I would say.

07:38.720 --> 07:44.240
It's also a fact that all these events that I sort of would pinpoint today to define my

07:44.240 --> 07:50.680
trajectory always involve human beings and always involve encounters, those resonance

07:50.680 --> 07:53.160
that I was talking about earlier.

07:53.160 --> 07:58.600
I cannot remember reading a book or reading a text and saying, this is going to change

07:58.600 --> 08:00.360
my life.

08:00.360 --> 08:07.440
But I can pinpoint a sentence that someone told me and that somehow became very important

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
in my life.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.440
Yeah.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.720
That changed the course of events in a sense.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.960
Well, I mean, I guess one of the things that I really want to mention is that, you know,

08:15.960 --> 08:20.840
by interacting with you over the years, one of the things I learned from you is an appreciation

08:20.840 --> 08:23.360
for the history of a problem.

08:23.360 --> 08:29.360
And so I found a very nice quote from Kepler from the Astronomia Nova.

08:29.360 --> 08:35.120
So he says, the roads by which men arrive at their insights into celestial matters seem

08:35.120 --> 08:39.680
to me almost as worthy of wonder as those matters themselves.

08:39.680 --> 08:43.880
So today I would like to try and draw, you know, your trajectory.

08:43.880 --> 08:49.480
You started from at least academically speaking from a paper with your PhD advisor, stability

08:49.520 --> 08:53.800
for dynamical systems with first integrals, a topological criteria.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.280
So something very mathematical and very much rooted in nonlinear control.

08:58.280 --> 09:03.040
And today I would say that your manifesto that we will talk about certainly in a second

09:03.040 --> 09:07.220
is towards building spiking control systems.

09:07.220 --> 09:11.000
So how do we connect these two points?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.600
What happened in the middle?

09:12.600 --> 09:18.880
Yeah, again, it's a very strange sequence of events and the events don't really explain

09:18.880 --> 09:21.320
the outcome.

09:21.320 --> 09:27.880
But I think that control theory requires a lot of mathematical abstraction.

09:27.880 --> 09:35.920
And at the same time, I think that control theory to me is really engineering driven.

09:35.920 --> 09:43.240
So the important contributions of control have always come from very concrete engineering

09:43.240 --> 09:44.880
questions.

09:44.880 --> 09:50.480
And it is this meeting point between the abstraction and the concreteness of the questions that

09:50.480 --> 09:55.420
attracts me and that I think has always attracted me in control.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.360
So my engineering education was quite mathematical.

09:58.360 --> 10:06.660
In fact, my specialty was mathematical engineering, if such a thing exists.

10:06.660 --> 10:12.960
So definitely I had a taste for mathematics, as I think many people in control have.

10:13.040 --> 10:20.920
But over the years, I became more and more sympathetic to the concreteness of control.

10:20.920 --> 10:27.440
And this is also what I like about the basic control courses, is that it's hard, I think,

10:27.440 --> 10:35.920
to pinpoint other courses early in the curriculum, where there is such a bridge made between,

10:35.920 --> 10:41.800
you know, the very concrete questions of making the speed of a motor insensitive to

10:41.800 --> 10:45.960
load and complex analysis.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.520
How comes that those things connect to each other?

10:48.520 --> 10:54.160
How comes that a little bit of abstraction is so powerful in providing such concrete

10:54.160 --> 10:58.040
answer that I find fascinating in control?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.440
I totally agree.

10:59.440 --> 11:05.440
And probably I wouldn't even have started this podcast if I weren't so fascinated.

11:05.440 --> 11:09.840
I guess here we are almost at a crossing point in the sense that we can either follow

11:09.840 --> 11:15.800
the chronological course of events and, you know, follow your trajectory starting from

11:15.800 --> 11:21.920
deep theoretical questions in nonlinear control or start in a bit of an unusual way right

11:21.920 --> 11:22.920
from the present.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.600
So what keeps you busy these days?

11:24.600 --> 11:27.640
And I would probably ask you, actually, what do you prefer?

11:27.640 --> 11:30.120
I have no preference.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.040
Of course, it's always easier to speak about the presence.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.360
That's what, you know, keeps me awake.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.920
So let's speak about the present.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.800
I think the present is a very exciting thing to talk about.

11:42.800 --> 11:48.360
At least I was reading the other day your paper on the IEEE proceedings, Spiking Control

11:48.360 --> 11:54.440
Systems, to me that is really a manifesto almost towards what are you going to do over

11:54.440 --> 11:57.640
the probably the next decade, I believe.

11:57.880 --> 12:04.120
I really liked one quote where you say explicitly, we aim at developing a control theory of spiking

12:04.120 --> 12:09.720
systems which will apply both to the natural world of biophysical neural circuits and the

12:09.720 --> 12:12.320
post digital technology of event based systems.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.080
I think that sentence is a masterpiece.

12:15.080 --> 12:22.280
And it somehow is transparent that you also want to inherit all the heritage from cybernetics.

12:22.320 --> 12:27.480
But moving forward, you want to incorporate new knowledge, let's say, coming from control

12:27.480 --> 12:32.280
systems and the mixed feedback principle that we will definitely talk about in a second.

12:32.280 --> 12:36.480
So what is your goal and your motivation, I would say, as well?

12:36.480 --> 12:46.480
Yeah, my motivation is very clearly to focus on the importance of event based systems and

12:46.480 --> 12:49.040
event based control.

12:49.040 --> 12:54.960
As a topic that has received, I would consider very, very little attention in control.

12:54.960 --> 13:03.360
The name I think was quote uncoined by Karl Astrum and his book chapter of 2007 that is

13:03.360 --> 13:05.940
called event based control.

13:05.940 --> 13:11.600
My reading of that book chapter is that itself it builds upon a paper that Karl Astrum wrote

13:11.600 --> 13:17.520
in 1991, together with Carl Vermeet, the father of neuromorphic engineering.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.280
And that brings the importance of events.

13:21.280 --> 13:28.360
And it's very, very defeating to talk about events and to do research about events nowadays,

13:28.360 --> 13:33.840
because our language and the language of information engineering has become so divided between

13:33.840 --> 13:38.560
the analog language on the one hand and digital language on the other hand.

13:38.560 --> 13:46.760
And events are clearly something that mixed the continuous and the digital.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.040
And as a control theorist, I've come to regard this story as a story of mixed feedback, the

13:54.040 --> 14:01.520
positive feedback being associated to discrete states and by stability and automata and the

14:01.520 --> 14:08.320
language of digital technology, and negative feedback being associated with homeostasis,

14:08.320 --> 14:13.920
regulation, and the theory of continuous regulation.

14:14.080 --> 14:19.760
It is only through time and because I was studying neuroscience and because I started

14:19.760 --> 14:24.880
reading what I was seeing in neuroscience as a theory of mixed feedback that I became

14:24.880 --> 14:30.360
aware that in fact cybernetics was a science of mixed feedback.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.400
And I think many people in the community would agree that the cybernetics age was a sort

14:34.400 --> 14:38.800
of a golden age, very short lived golden age of control.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.440
And that nowadays there are many signs that we are sort of returning to that age.

14:43.440 --> 14:49.400
But much better equipped, because in the meantime, we have developed fantastic tools

14:49.400 --> 14:57.400
that we can now use to reconsider questions that perhaps were ahead of their time.

14:57.400 --> 15:06.480
But definitely my view is that the digital age created this strong separation between

15:06.480 --> 15:11.880
positive feedback and negative feedback and that control theory became a theory of negative

15:11.880 --> 15:18.600
feedback and that it is a little bit today the trap where control theory or the corner

15:18.600 --> 15:25.800
where control theory is sitting, and that there is so much more to explore and to be

15:25.800 --> 15:32.960
connected both to biology, but also to now these fast developing event-based sensors

15:32.960 --> 15:39.720
and event-based actuators that is opening so many new questions and new path of research

15:39.760 --> 15:45.120
for control theories that I find is very, very exciting.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.920
There's a lot to unpack in what you just said.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.200
I just want to maybe mention a couple of things for our audience.

15:51.200 --> 15:56.280
And then I guess we will delve into some of the concepts that you mentioned so far.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.400
So first of all, I just want to mention to the audience of control theory, let's say

15:59.400 --> 16:01.880
that who Carver Mead is.

16:01.880 --> 16:06.800
Carver Mead worked with John Hopfield and Richard Feynman, novelist, helping to create

16:07.040 --> 16:11.920
three new fields, neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and the physics of computation.

16:11.920 --> 16:17.920
Just to name a few, he founded at least 20 companies from integrated circuits to silicon

16:17.920 --> 16:20.360
sensors for photographic imaging.

16:20.360 --> 16:25.000
So he was really a pioneering figure in the history of science.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.160
But since you were mentioning, first of all, the notion of mixed feedback or the mixed

16:31.160 --> 16:33.840
feedback principle, maybe we should try to unpack that.

16:33.880 --> 16:40.400
So what does that imply or how can we explain, let's say, to our audience, what is the mixed

16:40.400 --> 16:42.480
feedback principle?

16:42.480 --> 16:48.760
So the mixed feedback terminology comes from the mixed feedback amplifier that features

16:48.760 --> 16:57.240
the cover of the well-known textbooks of electrical circuits by Desueur and Shua from the 80s.

16:57.320 --> 17:03.880
And on the cover of the textbooks, you see the op-amp with a wire both connected to the

17:03.880 --> 17:08.880
negative part of the, so a feedback wire, a wire connecting the output of the amplifier

17:08.880 --> 17:14.360
both to the negative part of the amplifier and to the positive part of the amplifier.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.720
And the story of the feedback amplifier that we know in control theory, that I knew in

17:19.720 --> 17:23.400
control theory, was the story of negative feedback.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.800
Historically, things went the other way around.

17:27.800 --> 17:34.720
The first use of the op-amp was the positive feedback amplifier, because that was the way

17:34.720 --> 17:38.360
to design switches in analog systems.

17:38.360 --> 17:45.400
And so until the Second World War, the only way to realize switching circuits and circuits

17:45.400 --> 17:52.000
that were not equilibrium circuits was through positive feedback amplifiers.

17:52.040 --> 17:58.400
And this makes the discovery of Black, of the negative feedback amplifier, only more

17:58.400 --> 18:05.600
impressive that he had this vision that there could be a use of connecting the output of

18:05.600 --> 18:11.600
the op-amp to the negative part, because that would make the op-amp less sensitive to

18:11.600 --> 18:14.760
disturbance, less sensitive to uncertainty.

18:14.760 --> 18:21.680
And so we know that it took, I think, nine years for Black to get his discovery patented.

18:21.760 --> 18:27.480
And so that shows the spirit of the time, that why would you ever connect the output

18:27.480 --> 18:30.440
of a system to the negative part?

18:30.440 --> 18:35.080
And today we have just the opposite view, at least as a student.

18:35.080 --> 18:39.920
And I remember speaking to some control theorists and talking to them about positive feedback

18:39.920 --> 18:48.160
and seeing that face, that why would you ever connect the output of an op-amp to the positive part?

18:48.160 --> 18:55.200
And then the way I read any device in the body, and in particular in the brain, is a

18:55.200 --> 18:57.360
mixed feedback amplifier.

18:57.360 --> 19:05.000
And so nature somehow is making use of this mixed feedback amplification all the time.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.720
And I think for very good reasons.

19:08.720 --> 19:13.120
So yeah, this is my short story of the mixed feedback concept.

19:13.120 --> 19:17.280
Maybe like just to help the audience grasp what it really means.

19:17.280 --> 19:22.880
So I guess what you're advocating is that in a feedback loop, there's always, if we're

19:22.880 --> 19:28.760
interested, let's say, in building systems that range, let's say, from the analog behavior

19:28.760 --> 19:34.480
to the digital behavior, we should mix, really have elements that both have positive feedback

19:34.480 --> 19:39.720
and negative feedback in order to be able to capture, let's say, almost all behaviors

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
of interest.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.720
Is that fair to say?

19:42.720 --> 19:51.160
But at least in my view, to sort of reunite the two branches of control that are automation

19:51.160 --> 19:53.720
and regulation.

19:53.720 --> 19:59.440
So today, you know, the conferences are different, the classes are different, the textbooks are

19:59.440 --> 20:01.920
different, and you choose your side.

20:01.920 --> 20:09.680
Either you study automation through automata to the language of discrete states, finite

20:09.680 --> 20:16.000
state machines, or you study continuous control systems, and the world of regulation and the

20:16.000 --> 20:20.080
world of which is fundamentally an analog world.

20:20.080 --> 20:27.360
And I think that the best of those two worlds comes together when you consider mixed feedback.

20:27.360 --> 20:32.760
Something that was sort of, I think, very well appreciated in the 40s, the time where

20:32.760 --> 20:39.240
of the golden age of the mixed feedback amplifier, but then somehow disappeared from the field.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.080
I guess this is a good point where to mention how does the mixed feedback principle enter

20:46.080 --> 20:48.240
into the picture of neuroscience?

20:48.240 --> 20:55.560
So I guess we could mention some of the paradigmatic models of how a single neuron behaves.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.560
That's probably a good example.

20:56.560 --> 21:03.920
Well, of course, the fundamental model of neuronal excitability that goes back to Hodgkin

21:03.920 --> 21:11.600
and Huxley in 1952, is precisely the model of explaining the action potential of a neuron,

21:11.600 --> 21:18.480
so the spike, as through the analogy of an electrical circuit, where you attach to an

21:18.480 --> 21:24.680
RC circuit, so a passive circuit, you attach two current sources, one providing positive

21:24.680 --> 21:27.880
feedback and the other one providing negative feedback.

21:27.880 --> 21:34.240
And identifying those two current sources was the fundamental insight of Hodgkin and

21:34.240 --> 21:39.080
Huxley and is the mechanism of thresholds.

21:39.080 --> 21:47.200
And so what we, I think, the fundamental elements that we now see appearing in technology is

21:47.200 --> 21:49.400
the value of thresholds.

21:49.400 --> 21:56.120
And so as long as you use negative feedback, as long as you only consider negative feedback

21:56.360 --> 22:01.800
control, you are in the world of equilibrium systems, so you always reject disturbance

22:01.800 --> 22:04.760
and try to go back to equilibrium.

22:04.760 --> 22:09.620
The world of mixed feedback introduced this notion of threshold, that if the disturbance

22:09.620 --> 22:15.840
exceeds a certain level, you want to signal the disturbance and you signal through an

22:15.840 --> 22:22.240
event and that event is a spike and that event can be transmitted, can be communicated, there

22:22.240 --> 22:24.680
is something happening.

22:24.680 --> 22:30.480
I find this extremely important in every behavior and of course we could take the example

22:30.480 --> 22:38.240
of robotics, but in fact any single control system that you look at is just jumping from

22:38.240 --> 22:40.440
event to event.

22:40.440 --> 22:46.820
And again, that goes back very much to the early view of cybernetics and I like the one

22:46.820 --> 22:53.940
of Ross Ashby in particular, who developed this concept of ultra-stability, thinking

22:53.940 --> 23:02.260
of machines as systems that switch between discrete states, like an automaton, however

23:02.260 --> 23:06.660
each of these states being continuously regulated.

23:06.660 --> 23:13.780
And so it is sort of a mixture between an automaton and it's a regulated automaton.

23:13.780 --> 23:19.980
It is a concept that is very, very clear and present in the early days of cybernetics,

23:19.980 --> 23:25.420
but there was no theory at the time to formulate that concept.

23:25.420 --> 23:29.780
And I think that, so that has been at the core of my research to try to now use the

23:29.780 --> 23:39.980
current theory of control to formulate what would be and how should we model such a machine.

23:39.980 --> 23:45.940
Since you mentioned the notion of, you know, dynamics away from equilibrium, this is just

23:45.940 --> 23:46.940
a personal curiosity.

23:46.940 --> 23:53.820
Have you ever thought about like the links between what you're studying today and thermodynamics?

23:53.820 --> 23:56.220
So something that you didn't like so much.

23:56.220 --> 24:00.780
So it seems like at least locally, you're going against the principles of thermodynamics,

24:00.780 --> 24:06.940
you're generating order in a way, I don't know if I'm making sense.

24:06.940 --> 24:14.820
I think that thermodynamics away from equilibrium, as it was developed in the 80s and very popular

24:14.820 --> 24:24.900
in the 90s, is indeed very much the analog of the way, you know, chemical reactions and

24:24.900 --> 24:28.820
which at the end, those neurons are made of.

24:28.820 --> 24:35.580
So how can chemical reactions away from equilibrium generate order, generate patterns, generate...

24:35.580 --> 24:43.340
So at sort of a high conceptual level, yes, there is clearly a lot of resonance between

24:43.340 --> 24:49.980
the idea of thermodynamics out of equilibrium and the idea of control out of equilibrium.

24:49.980 --> 24:56.140
But of course, and I'm not an expert of thermodynamics, but when I discuss thermodynamics out of equilibrium

24:56.140 --> 25:02.300
with experts, I hear that we are very far away from having a proper theory of thermodynamics

25:02.300 --> 25:03.300
away from equilibrium.

25:03.860 --> 25:06.420
It's probably too early to talk about these questions.

25:06.420 --> 25:10.580
Somebody who will listen to this podcast in the future, 50 years away from now, will have

25:10.580 --> 25:12.380
some answers, hopefully.

25:12.380 --> 25:17.820
Since you mentioned event-based systems, and I guess one of the main applications you have

25:17.820 --> 25:22.300
in mind are potentially event-based cameras, I think maybe we can dig into that.

25:22.300 --> 25:27.180
So I guess those are the applications you have in mind, probably.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.180
Is that fair to say?

25:28.180 --> 25:30.340
Or is that more a twist?

25:30.380 --> 25:37.460
Well, I think that when I talk about mixed feedback, people often talk about my interest

25:37.460 --> 25:38.460
in neuroscience.

25:38.460 --> 25:43.140
And indeed, it is because of my interest in neuroscience that I became interested in mixed

25:43.140 --> 25:49.820
feedback and that I became sort of obsessed to try to reconcile theory, control theory

25:49.820 --> 25:52.740
with the mixed feedback principle.

25:52.740 --> 25:58.980
But in the recent years, and since I sort of discovered this whole community of neuromorphic

25:58.980 --> 26:05.740
engineering and event-based sensing, it occurred to me that in fact, even away from neuroscience,

26:05.740 --> 26:11.420
there is a huge potential of exploring event-based control.

26:11.420 --> 26:16.220
And for instance, if you look at the book chapter of Karl Armstrong on event-based control,

26:16.220 --> 26:21.940
his motivation comes from all possible applications of control, but neuroscience.

26:21.940 --> 26:29.860
So it's also a way for me to sort of go back in my home country, which is the theory of

26:29.860 --> 26:35.340
control systems, and to think away from neuroscience of the potential use of mixed feedback or

26:35.340 --> 26:38.700
the potential use of thresholds.

26:38.700 --> 26:46.540
And clearly, we now see an explosion of event-based sensors and event-based actuators.

26:46.540 --> 26:52.500
So sooner or later, control engineers will be called to connect them together.

26:52.500 --> 26:57.300
And I think it's fair to say that at the moment, we don't have a theory to connect an event-based

26:57.300 --> 27:00.540
sensors to an event-based actuator.

27:00.540 --> 27:05.660
The way we do it at the moment is that we interface the event-based sensors with a digital

27:05.660 --> 27:07.500
processor.

27:07.500 --> 27:13.400
And then we interface the output of the digital processor, maybe to an event-based actuator.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.020
And that's how we close the loop.

27:15.020 --> 27:21.220
But of course, it's very tempting to think that in some specific cases, we could short

27:21.220 --> 27:27.500
circuit this interface and go straight from the event-based sensors to the event-based

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
actuator.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.780
It makes a lot of sense.

27:31.780 --> 27:37.740
Also, I guess, very trivially, potentially, just for energetic considerations.

27:37.740 --> 27:43.540
So all of the systems that you're mentioning are very much energy, what's the opposite

27:43.540 --> 27:44.540
of energy-hungry?

27:44.540 --> 27:48.700
They would be not very consuming in terms of energy.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.700
Yeah.

27:49.700 --> 27:57.180
So this is one advantage that is very often put forward, especially nowadays in the energy

27:57.180 --> 28:04.500
crisis that we experience, that event-based is also a potential solution to the carbon

28:04.500 --> 28:09.920
footprint of current technology, and in particular, digital technology.

28:09.920 --> 28:16.560
When I was a student, it was the beginning of the internet, and we really presented digital

28:16.560 --> 28:23.280
technology and digital information as a free technology, as an energy-free technology.

28:23.280 --> 28:30.760
And it's funny that 30 years later, especially after this pandemic, suddenly the carbon footprint

28:30.760 --> 28:33.640
of digital technology is making news.

28:33.640 --> 28:42.460
And everyone is sort of becoming very worried about the growing energy demand of the storing,

28:42.460 --> 28:48.400
but not just storage, but all the devices that come with information technology.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.360
And I think that that's exactly the vision of Kaveh Mead.

28:51.360 --> 28:57.280
And Kaveh Mead saw that at the end of the 80s, so long ahead of his time, perhaps because

28:57.280 --> 29:03.640
he was at the very forefront of digital technology, and he could foresee that this Moore's law

29:03.640 --> 29:10.120
that he formulated himself would not go forever, and that there would be a time where we would

29:10.120 --> 29:15.800
be hit by the limitation of digital technology, including the, and prime and foremost, the

29:15.800 --> 29:18.840
energy demand of digital technology.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.640
And I think we are living exactly in that time.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.080
This is a good segue for me to talk about energy.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.360
Energy from a control theoretic perspective.

29:28.360 --> 29:36.040
So very much part of your theoretical investigations is the concept of dissipativity.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.920
And that's one of the pillars of systems theory.

29:38.920 --> 29:43.920
So maybe you can guide us through how does that interwine with the mixed feedback principle,

29:43.920 --> 29:49.720
neuroscience, and your current obsession about monotonicity.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.200
Don't get me started, because it would become a seminar.

29:53.200 --> 30:01.760
But yeah, it's true that I think that dissipativity is a central concept of control theory, for

30:01.760 --> 30:06.720
many reasons, but prime and foremost, because it describes this interaction between the

30:06.720 --> 30:13.000
external and internal that I was mentioning earlier, in energetic terms.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.280
So how does the external supply of energy relates to the internal storage of energy?

30:20.280 --> 30:26.840
I think it's a very profound way of describing how a system or how physical systems interacts

30:26.840 --> 30:29.320
with its environment.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.520
It's not the only reason why dissipativity is so important.

30:32.520 --> 30:38.000
I think that, so dissipativity is a bridge, but it's not just a bridge between the external

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
and the internal.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
It's also a bridge between mechanics and electricity, because it's also a bridge between

30:45.000 --> 30:51.440
the input-output description of systems and the state-space description of a system.

30:51.440 --> 30:57.640
So it is also a bridge between the heritage of electricity, where we think of circuits

30:57.640 --> 31:04.000
as interconnection of input-output devices, and the heritage of mechanics, where we think

31:04.000 --> 31:10.480
of systems as determined by, let's say, Newton's law and governing the motion from an initial

31:10.480 --> 31:12.960
condition.

31:12.960 --> 31:19.440
Dissipativity really interconnects those two worlds, generalizing the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov

31:19.440 --> 31:25.520
lemma, which is perhaps the fundamental heritage of our field.

31:25.520 --> 31:32.560
And this bridge is not just a bridge between physics and analysis, between input-output

31:32.560 --> 31:33.560
and state-space.

31:33.560 --> 31:41.040
It is also a bridge between physics and computation, because it is also through that bridge that

31:41.040 --> 31:45.180
linear control theory became algorithmic.

31:45.180 --> 31:53.400
It is fascinating that in the dissipativity paper of Ian Williams, the LMI is almost mentioned

31:53.400 --> 32:01.280
there en passant, but in fact precedes by 20 years the reformulation of control theory

32:01.600 --> 32:08.640
of every important control theoretic question as the solution of context optimization problem.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.360
So yes, dissipativity is important in many ways.

32:13.360 --> 32:19.440
And then when I moved to mixed feedback, when I moved to neuroscience, I was very frustrated

32:19.440 --> 32:26.600
that somehow I could not use this theory, or I was always hoping for.

32:26.600 --> 32:34.160
And I think here, perhaps I have to mention how I came to connect mixed feedback to dissipativity.

32:34.160 --> 32:40.280
And this is thanks to a question from Malcolm Smith, my close colleague.

32:40.280 --> 32:47.560
I had given my TED talk in 2014 about mixed feedback and, you know, praising the use of

32:47.560 --> 32:49.160
mixed feedback.

32:49.160 --> 32:54.520
And then I had this conversation with Malcolm and Malcolm said, by the way, how do you define

32:54.520 --> 32:56.520
negative feedback?

32:56.520 --> 33:08.400
Yeah, you have to, I mean, the value of such questions is, I think that most of my research

33:08.400 --> 33:15.080
comes from such questions that are sometimes asked by colleagues, most of the times asked

33:15.080 --> 33:17.860
by my students, by my postdocs.

33:17.860 --> 33:22.000
It's really through those conversations that you realize that something that you found

33:22.000 --> 33:25.460
evident and self-explanatory, in fact, is not.

33:25.460 --> 33:30.440
And that is pushing you further into digging into the question.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.160
So how do you define?

33:32.160 --> 33:38.280
And the point of Malcolm was that defining what negative feedback is, is what led to

33:38.280 --> 33:40.020
control theory.

33:40.020 --> 33:46.120
Because after the invention of the feedback amplifier, very quickly, people start experiencing

33:46.120 --> 33:48.240
instability with negative feedback.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.280
How could possibly negative feedback lead to instability?

33:51.560 --> 33:56.880
Aha, well, this is because the dynamics of the plan can, in fact, change the sign of

33:56.880 --> 34:01.080
the feedback in the loop because of the phase shift.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.720
And this leads to the frequency response and Nyquist.

34:04.720 --> 34:09.880
So the whole heritage of control is in that question somehow.

34:09.880 --> 34:15.740
Now through the question of Malcolm, I realized that there was something missing in connecting

34:15.980 --> 34:22.860
mixed feedback to, let's say, dissipativity, because the only way you can define the sign

34:22.860 --> 34:29.620
of a feedback loop in a nonlinear system is by thinking incrementally.

34:29.620 --> 34:35.260
So if the feedback signal is a current signal, what determines the sign of the feedback loop

34:35.260 --> 34:39.860
is not whether the current is an inward or outward current.

34:39.860 --> 34:45.940
It is whether the current source has positive conductance or negative conductance.

34:45.940 --> 34:53.820
That distinction between the sign of a current and the incremental sign of a current is something

34:53.820 --> 35:00.900
that I didn't appreciate until I started working in that area, until I started discovering

35:00.900 --> 35:08.540
how much it is a source of confusion in neuroscience and how much it is a source of confusion in

35:08.540 --> 35:10.780
control.

35:10.780 --> 35:18.260
That we, because of the heritage of the linear theory, we always tend to think of incremental

35:18.260 --> 35:23.460
quantities and non-incremental quantities as equivalents, but they are only equivalent

35:23.460 --> 35:26.140
for linear systems.

35:26.140 --> 35:33.000
And this is how I started realizing that all what I knew in nonlinear control was rooted

35:33.000 --> 35:39.280
in a non-incremental approach, including dissipativity.

35:39.280 --> 35:46.760
So the dissipativity, the definition of dissipativity of Williams is nonlinear, but it is non-incremental.

35:46.760 --> 35:55.000
That is, solutions are always evaluated with respect to the zero storage, the equilibrium

35:55.000 --> 35:59.120
solution that corresponds to the minimal storage.

35:59.120 --> 36:05.600
Instead of evaluating solutions with respect to each other.

36:05.600 --> 36:11.640
And that has indeed become a sort of an obsession to realize that we didn't have an incremental

36:11.640 --> 36:14.880
form of dissipativity theory.

36:14.880 --> 36:21.480
And for many years I tried, and I don't think I'm the only one who tried to explain and

36:21.480 --> 36:29.160
understand why we didn't have an incremental form of dissipativity, until I sort of came

36:29.160 --> 36:33.920
up to the conclusion that in fact, we don't have a theory of incremental dissipativity

36:33.920 --> 36:41.720
because we don't have, it's very, very difficult to think of states-based models that have

36:41.720 --> 36:45.560
incremental input-output properties.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.280
That gap is a total surprise to me.

36:48.280 --> 36:53.280
It is very much, it's very close to my current research question.

36:53.280 --> 36:57.600
And again, it is something that independently from neuroscience, independently from the

36:57.600 --> 37:03.240
particular application that led to those questions, I think is a question, is an important question

37:03.240 --> 37:08.720
for the field is how do you define a nonlinear capacitor?

37:08.720 --> 37:14.880
And I've come to the conclusion that the classical state-space definition of a nonlinear capacitor

37:15.200 --> 37:24.160
that's, for instance, was advocated by Shua and that is rarely questioned, in fact is

37:24.160 --> 37:32.000
problematic because it gives us a model of a nonlinear integrator that is not incrementally

37:32.000 --> 37:34.440
passive.

37:34.440 --> 37:44.080
And this whole path from dissipativity to mixed feedback and sort of back to dissipativity

37:44.080 --> 37:53.080
is to me, an example of how research sort of evolves and how ultimately the only way

37:53.080 --> 38:02.280
to formulate new questions that can be extremely theoretical and fundamental is always in control

38:02.280 --> 38:04.840
driven by very concrete questions.

38:04.840 --> 38:13.800
So I would never have imagined to question the state-space model of a nonlinear capacitor

38:13.800 --> 38:20.040
unless I had been pushed to refine what I meant by positive and negative feedback and

38:20.040 --> 38:26.560
how I can sort of encapsulate these concepts that are clear to everyone because they are

38:26.560 --> 38:31.880
everyday concepts, but if you want to turn them into a mathematical theory, you have

38:31.880 --> 38:38.480
to work hard and then you eventually discover that the theory is incomplete.

38:38.520 --> 38:43.680
I think this is the path of research in many problems in control theory.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.680
Again, there is a lot to unpack there.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.960
It was a fantastic journey just to follow your line of thought.

38:52.800 --> 38:58.320
Maybe, OK, the first comment that I have is very curious that at the end of the day, we end up

38:58.320 --> 39:06.280
talking so much about a sign change in a sense or whether it's positive feedback or negative

39:06.280 --> 39:13.000
feedback. Another thing that I can extrapolate from line of thought is that, well, I'm going

39:13.000 --> 39:16.560
to quote Sherlock Holmes from Scandal in Bohemia.

39:16.600 --> 39:22.760
He says that it is a capital mistake to theorize that before one has data, insensibly one

39:22.760 --> 39:27.000
begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.080
And this is very much resonating with what you said.

39:30.440 --> 39:35.480
So it seems to me also that, yeah, we are in a situation in control theory at the moment

39:35.480 --> 39:41.680
where we very much see what Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions predicted.

39:41.680 --> 39:48.880
So there are phases in science where there is a growing miscontent with theories that in

39:48.880 --> 39:54.000
some way do not satisfy, they're not able to answer questions that we do have.

39:54.680 --> 40:00.960
And yeah, the last comment I have is that it's quite funny that we always end up talking,

40:01.360 --> 40:07.560
at least in the background, there is always the figure of Jan Willems kind of foreseeing the

40:07.560 --> 40:13.360
importance of so many of these questions, including dissipativity and the tension between

40:13.360 --> 40:14.720
paradigms and puzzles.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.240
So, yeah, that's very true.

40:17.680 --> 40:22.080
And there is a lot in what you just said in a few words.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.840
I agree. And I think that it's not special to our fields.

40:26.840 --> 40:32.120
In fact, perhaps this is the value of venturing in neighboring fields.

40:32.360 --> 40:37.240
So, for instance, I worked for maybe 10 years in optimization and manifolds and was really a

40:37.240 --> 40:42.240
journey outside of my field, I would say, had not much to do with control.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.960
Then I ventured in neuroscience, in neurodynamics, again, in another neighboring

40:46.960 --> 40:52.480
community. And in all those communities, I always observed what you just described.

40:53.160 --> 40:58.680
I think it's inevitable that a topic becomes a topic because it becomes popular.

40:59.320 --> 41:07.880
And even if initially it emerged from a very concrete question, maybe after one generation,

41:08.720 --> 41:16.160
it becomes a theory that is somehow independent from the question that led to the theory.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.520
And the next generation just works on the theory.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.320
And there is nothing wrong about that because you want to deepen the theory.

41:24.480 --> 41:30.800
The only problem is that this by deepening the theory, you know, you create more expertise

41:30.800 --> 41:36.440
and you create theory that is more and more detached from the original question that

41:36.440 --> 41:37.640
motivated the theory.

41:38.560 --> 41:45.040
And inevitably, eventually, this theory sort of detaches itself from reality.

41:45.040 --> 41:52.040
And and at that time, I think there is indeed the danger that it becomes sort of self

41:52.040 --> 41:57.200
referencing. But as soon as something becomes self referencing, it dies very quickly.

41:57.840 --> 42:04.400
So I think I feel much more in peace with that phenomenon nowadays because I think there

42:04.400 --> 42:06.200
is nothing wrong in that phenomenon.

42:06.200 --> 42:12.680
Perhaps initially I thought, oh, but my field is bad because people are going that way.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.720
I don't think it is specific to my field.

42:16.760 --> 42:20.280
I think it is specific to the mechanism of research.

42:20.880 --> 42:25.480
It just shows the importance of diversity in science.

42:25.720 --> 42:32.200
I think of all my journeys in neighboring disciplines as sort of going into a foreign

42:32.200 --> 42:34.520
country for a while and then going back home.

42:35.240 --> 42:39.920
And to me, it has always been important to come back home because this is where I feel

42:39.920 --> 42:42.840
home. And I think it's important to have a home.

42:43.320 --> 42:49.160
But it's also by traveling that you realize, first of all, that you realize the value of

42:49.160 --> 42:50.600
your own identity.

42:51.080 --> 42:57.000
And nowadays, I think I have much higher appreciation for the value of control than I had

42:57.000 --> 42:58.960
before venturing in other fields.

42:59.880 --> 43:05.320
But it also makes you aware of the importance of diversity because it's only by, you

43:05.320 --> 43:10.760
know, venturing and by traveling that you encounter new questions that you and this is

43:10.760 --> 43:13.200
very refreshing. This is very important.

43:13.200 --> 43:18.160
So there is indeed a tension, I think, and we have to be very careful about that tension.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.240
There is no easy answer.

43:20.280 --> 43:25.200
Otherwise, it's part of the cycle of of life in a sense.

43:26.160 --> 43:30.560
Yeah, I mean, it seems almost an evolutionary process in a sense.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.880
So theories do tend, as you say, to evolve on their own.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.680
But at the same time, if they do that too much, they die.

43:37.120 --> 43:41.280
Yeah, I think it's super interesting, potentially like the topic of another podcast

43:41.720 --> 43:47.560
episode. I just want to close the loop maybe on on the, let's say, nonlinear control side of

43:47.560 --> 43:53.120
things, because we didn't touch on, at least in depth, on some of the concepts that I think

43:53.120 --> 43:59.160
are key and also made you win, for example, an Axelby Prize recently on the concept of

43:59.160 --> 44:05.440
dissipativity. And maybe they're so and we're talking about the concept of P-dominance

44:05.440 --> 44:07.600
for those who are not familiar with it.

44:07.600 --> 44:13.000
There will be a link in the description and, you know, the concept of contraction, the

44:13.000 --> 44:16.360
concept of positivity and the concept of monotonicity.

44:16.640 --> 44:23.280
So how do all of these notions interwine and why are they so fundamental in a way?

44:24.160 --> 44:31.640
OK, again, there is danger that I start a seminar here, but at the core of all these

44:31.640 --> 44:36.640
questions is, again, the difference between incremental and non-incremental.

44:37.000 --> 44:45.280
And I think it's best to start with the concept that is perhaps the most common concept to

44:45.480 --> 44:50.720
every control theory, the concept of stability, and even more so the concept of Lyapunov

44:50.720 --> 44:55.640
stability, which is a concept of internal stability, so state-space concept.

44:56.880 --> 45:02.760
Lyapunov stability is non-incremental, it is stability with respect to an equilibrium

45:02.760 --> 45:08.640
solution. The non-incremental, the incremental form of Lyapunov stability is

45:08.960 --> 45:18.320
contraction. And contraction was introduced in our field in 98, this paper of Slotin and

45:18.360 --> 45:26.000
Lou Miller, that I think is a turning point in our appreciation of incremental properties

45:26.560 --> 45:28.280
in the state-space domain.

45:29.040 --> 45:37.520
And we see nowadays, 15 years, 25 years after this, the publication of this paper, that

45:37.520 --> 45:40.480
indeed contraction has become widely appreciated.

45:40.800 --> 45:49.120
And I think that there is a wide appreciation of why contraction is important and perhaps

45:50.040 --> 45:54.120
more important in many engineering questions than Lyapunov stability.

45:54.520 --> 45:59.680
But contraction is just an incremental form, in my thinking, is just an incremental form of

45:59.680 --> 46:00.680
Lyapunov stability.

46:01.440 --> 46:07.800
Now, this is all about an internal concept of stability or a state-space concept.

46:08.720 --> 46:11.480
What about the input-output concepts?

46:11.800 --> 46:16.840
Input-output stability is well understood in the linear case.

46:17.440 --> 46:21.880
In the non-linear case, the incremental form of input-output stability is an incremental

46:21.880 --> 46:27.920
gain. And there is some theory about incremental L2 gains.

46:28.480 --> 46:35.800
But a big missing bit of the control theory today is the lack of concept of incremental

46:35.880 --> 46:41.320
passivity. That brings us back to the question I was alluding to earlier.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.080
Why don't we have an incremental form of dissipativity?

46:46.160 --> 46:51.280
And so the notion of incremental passivity is very well understood in an input-output

46:51.280 --> 46:57.440
setting. If you go back to the early work of the textbooks of de Zuhr and Vidya Sagar, for

46:57.440 --> 47:04.080
instance, passivity and incremental passivity are treated on equal foot, I would say.

47:04.680 --> 47:10.440
But in my education, which is post-input-output theory, which is very much state-space

47:10.440 --> 47:17.880
theory, because from the 80s, non-linear control became dominated by state-space

47:18.440 --> 47:19.760
modelling approaches.

47:20.440 --> 47:25.120
The incremental concept is pretty much absent of any textbooks of non-linear control.

47:25.520 --> 47:30.160
So non-linear control theory is very much a non-incremental theory nowadays.

47:30.920 --> 47:34.120
And I think it's because of the state-space model concept.

47:34.160 --> 47:41.000
So my effort in revisiting incremental passivity, and that is what led me to this notion

47:41.000 --> 47:43.800
of monotonicity. What is monotonicity?

47:43.840 --> 47:45.840
It's incremental positivity.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.800
So we have what are the notions of positivity?

47:49.800 --> 47:55.080
Or we have many notions of positivity, because when we go from scalar to vectors and then

47:55.280 --> 48:01.160
we go from vectors to operators, well, there are many ways to generalise the concept of

48:01.160 --> 48:06.120
positivity. Passivity is one concept of positivity out of many.

48:07.640 --> 48:14.200
And monotonicity as the incremental form of passivity is one concept of monotonicity

48:14.200 --> 48:15.240
among others.

48:15.560 --> 48:22.200
It's an input-output concept of monotonicity that I've discovered by going back to the

48:22.200 --> 48:28.040
early days of circuit theory and by discovering that the person who invented the concept of

48:28.040 --> 48:36.320
monotonicity, Minty in 1960, was precisely trying to answer a question that I've had to

48:36.320 --> 48:37.560
answer for the last 10 years.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.320
What is a non-linear resistor?

48:39.520 --> 48:43.400
How do you define an element with positive conductance?

48:43.800 --> 48:50.360
Here we go. That's also the value of re-studying history from time to time is that very,

48:50.360 --> 48:53.920
very often you discover the answer to your questions.

48:54.160 --> 48:58.560
You discover that they have been previously answered, but then they have been forgotten.

48:59.440 --> 49:05.120
And so I became very interested in the input-output concept of monotonicity invented by

49:05.120 --> 49:10.400
Minty, the fact that it then became a sort of foundation of convex optimisation.

49:10.400 --> 49:17.600
So again, this bridge between physical modelling and computation is very much there and it

49:17.600 --> 49:20.520
is there in the incremental form of passivity.

49:20.880 --> 49:27.080
It is not there in the non-incremental form of passivity, which was the topic of my first

49:27.080 --> 49:36.080
book, so of my early days in control, using passivity as a fundamental concept to, let's

49:36.080 --> 49:38.320
say, solve stabilisation questions.

49:39.280 --> 49:45.760
But the non-linear passivity concept, the non-incremental form of passivity, is a very

49:45.960 --> 49:51.800
nice concept, of course, because it retains a physical meaning, but it's not an algorithmic

49:51.800 --> 49:53.200
concept for sure.

49:54.440 --> 50:01.360
And so the fact that a negative conductance, so a resistance with negative conductance

50:01.360 --> 50:10.440
could be a passive element, started really showing the value of clarifying the incremental

50:10.440 --> 50:16.120
properties of a device and not just the non-incremental passivity property of a device.

50:16.960 --> 50:21.520
Sorry if it is too long of an answer to your question, but it's never too long, never.

50:22.800 --> 50:28.040
I guess when you refer to conductance, you mean differential conductance or incremental

50:28.040 --> 50:30.800
conductance. That's what you conceptually visualise.

50:30.840 --> 50:34.800
Because I think that conductance should be understood only differentially.

50:35.440 --> 50:40.480
The notion of chordal conductance or non-incremental conductance is not really

50:40.480 --> 50:46.000
meaningful. Monotonicity means that the slope of your function is always positive.

50:46.680 --> 50:52.120
But what is the meaning of positivity with respect to zero, that the graph of your function

50:52.120 --> 50:54.160
lies in the first and third quadrants?

50:55.360 --> 51:01.040
Yes, it is a property, but it's a property that has nothing to do with monotonicity.

51:01.640 --> 51:08.000
And I think one would agree that for most problems, the property of monotonicity would be

51:08.000 --> 51:13.600
far more important than the property of positivity, of non-incremental positivity.

51:14.280 --> 51:20.480
I hear a lot of, let's say, resonance with one of your latest editorials on the IEEE

51:20.480 --> 51:22.120
controlled magazines systems.

51:22.160 --> 51:25.640
I should mention that Rodolf is the editor-in-chief of that journal.

51:25.640 --> 51:29.560
I'll put a link in the description to the journal and the editorials.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.960
The last one at this stage is about the art of the state.

51:34.400 --> 51:42.600
And it's really a campaign to almost overthrow the state space modelling in favour of

51:42.600 --> 51:48.520
something that is more tractable and something that is also, I would say, more robust for

51:48.520 --> 51:50.800
the purpose of algorithmic computation.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.320
Is that fair to say, you think?

51:53.440 --> 51:59.520
I'm always sorry when I hear that I'm campaigning against something because it is

51:59.520 --> 52:03.600
certainly not my intention to campaign against state space modelling.

52:04.040 --> 52:11.680
To me, the value of control is precisely in bridging the state space world of mechanics

52:11.680 --> 52:15.280
and the input-output world of electricity.

52:16.520 --> 52:19.040
So my campaign is for that bridge.

52:19.840 --> 52:22.120
It's not that we should be one-sided.

52:22.520 --> 52:27.640
And it is for that bridge because my view of control theory or for non-linear control

52:27.640 --> 52:31.400
theory is that today that it's very much dominated by state space, so it's very much

52:31.400 --> 52:32.400
one-sided.

52:33.280 --> 52:39.920
And it's not an accident that every application of non-linear control nowadays is in,

52:40.680 --> 52:47.360
well, I should say nearly, almost application is in robotics rather than in electronics.

52:47.880 --> 52:53.960
In fact, the contact between control and circuits disappeared in the non-linear age.

52:54.600 --> 52:59.600
So if you open a textbook on non-linear control, there is very, very little about non-linear

52:59.600 --> 53:05.080
circuits. And if you open a textbook about non-linear circuits, there is very, very little

53:05.080 --> 53:14.120
about control. And my efforts to model neural systems as non-linear circuits has pushed

53:14.120 --> 53:21.680
me to study and learn the old theory that was developed in the 70s that was all coming

53:21.680 --> 53:28.880
from circuit theory and aiming at developing a non-linear feedback system theory inspired

53:28.880 --> 53:29.880
by circuit theory.

53:30.480 --> 53:37.200
And so if I'm campaigning for something, it's only to restore the importance of this

53:37.200 --> 53:42.000
input-output approach and the value of the bridge between the input-output approach and

53:42.000 --> 53:46.680
the state space approach. It's not at all against the, I mean, of course, the concept of

53:46.680 --> 53:52.000
state space is extraordinarily important and a very, very important heritage of our

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
field.

53:53.880 --> 53:58.080
Yeah, so I guess it would be more fair to say that you're campaigning to resurrect the

53:58.080 --> 54:03.680
bridge that once upon a time was so evident and perhaps these days is not so much.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.840
Yes.

54:05.880 --> 54:09.360
I guess, again, here, from here, we could take many directions.

54:09.400 --> 54:14.560
I have a couple of questions that I do want to ask you about, let's say, the implications

54:14.560 --> 54:18.600
of your research in neuroscience before maybe we move on and touch on other topics.

54:19.440 --> 54:24.240
Some of these are maybe a bit provocative and they're like the aim at fantasizing, if

54:24.240 --> 54:29.720
you want, about what can we achieve if we understand the mechanisms by which neurons

54:29.720 --> 54:31.840
or even the brain work?

54:32.040 --> 54:38.520
So the question broadly would be really, what can we achieve, say, in the next decade, 20

54:38.520 --> 54:42.240
years, 100 years, if we push forward this concept?

54:42.240 --> 54:46.120
And, for example, I don't know, what can we say about perception?

54:46.160 --> 54:51.960
How is it integrated or is there any hope about saying something about how consciousness

54:51.960 --> 54:52.960
arises?

54:54.160 --> 55:01.680
I'm not a neuroscientist, and so I don't think I'm qualified to make any prediction about

55:01.680 --> 55:02.920
the future of neuroscience.

55:02.960 --> 55:10.800
What I see through my colleagues who are neuroscientists is that there also there is a

55:10.920 --> 55:13.280
resurrection of the cybernetics age.

55:14.000 --> 55:20.640
So the whole effort of cybernetics was to think of the brain as a machine and to approach

55:20.640 --> 55:25.720
the brain. So the British father of cybernetics, Ross Ashby, was not a control theorist, was

55:25.720 --> 55:27.640
not an engineer. He was a psychiatrist.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.520
And it was part of this.

55:31.040 --> 55:37.160
It was very much at the genesis of cybernetics to approach the understanding of the brain

55:37.560 --> 55:39.360
from an engineering perspective.

55:39.760 --> 55:47.520
And then with the rise of molecular biology, neuroscience became a quantitative science

55:47.520 --> 55:55.080
and it became very much dominated by a very scientific approach of describing the brain,

55:55.080 --> 56:00.440
describing the anatomy of the brain, describing the anatomy of the neural circuits and

56:00.680 --> 56:05.200
understanding the neural circuits from those scientific descriptions.

56:05.640 --> 56:10.360
We see an illustration of that fact with, for instance, the emphasis nowadays on

56:10.360 --> 56:16.840
connectomics, that, you know, as if understanding the connectome of a large network would

56:16.840 --> 56:18.640
tell you how the network works.

56:20.040 --> 56:26.680
And I think that nowadays there is more and more appreciation in neuroscience that if

56:26.680 --> 56:31.040
we want to think of if we want to make progress in understanding the brain, it's not

56:31.040 --> 56:34.480
enough to have this scientific description of the brain.

56:34.480 --> 56:38.240
We need also to understand the mechanism of the brain.

56:38.240 --> 56:44.000
And it's very valuable to approach those mechanisms from an engineering perspective.

56:44.720 --> 56:51.560
And again, there is always a balance in neuroscience and in every science between science

56:51.560 --> 56:57.840
and engineering. So in neuroscience, you have a balance between the quest of understanding

56:57.840 --> 57:02.920
the brain and the medical desire of curing diseases.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.760
OK, and there is a tension between those two.

57:05.760 --> 57:12.560
But I think that the value of it's also that I love this claim of Feynman, who is

57:12.840 --> 57:18.880
perhaps the most theoretical physicist of our time, but saying understanding is building.

57:19.040 --> 57:25.120
So the idea that it is by building a machine that mimics the brain that we will

57:25.160 --> 57:26.520
understand the brain.

57:26.600 --> 57:29.480
I quite like that view and that approach.

57:29.480 --> 57:34.920
And so that is closer to my field because control is about design.

57:35.400 --> 57:39.440
And to me, control is design under uncertainty.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.520
I think this is a concept that resonates very much with the current approach of thinking

57:46.520 --> 57:54.360
of brain as producing extremely reliable functions out of huge uncertainty and

57:54.360 --> 57:56.000
sloppiness in the components.

57:56.360 --> 58:02.360
So how much so much variability in the anatomical components of the brain can lead to

58:02.360 --> 58:04.680
such reliable brain functions?

58:04.960 --> 58:07.880
I think that's a core question of neuroscience today.

58:08.760 --> 58:10.760
That's why I think it's a control question.

58:11.080 --> 58:16.920
And I think that as a control theorist, I see this as a key question for the future of

58:16.920 --> 58:19.120
artificial intelligence and the future of robotics.

58:19.120 --> 58:25.360
How can we design intelligence machines, so machines that are closer to what we

58:25.360 --> 58:31.400
experience in natural intelligence and deal with the uncertainty and deal with the

58:31.480 --> 58:33.680
sloppiness of the components?

58:34.040 --> 58:39.720
And I expect a lot of progress and a lot of synergy and interaction between

58:39.720 --> 58:43.320
neuroscience and control engineering along those lines.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.800
So maybe we're going to cut this later.

58:46.800 --> 58:48.600
So you mentioned at the outset.

58:49.080 --> 58:54.240
So we're looking forward to seeing the relationship between control and neuroscience

58:54.240 --> 58:59.760
condensing in your upcoming book with Guillaume Drion and Alessio Franchi, whose title

58:59.760 --> 59:04.280
is, if I remember correctly, Neuromorphic Controlled Principles.

59:04.280 --> 59:04.840
Is that right?

59:05.720 --> 59:06.840
And we're looking forward to that.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.400
Yeah.

59:07.680 --> 59:11.200
You know, there are many, many books out there that are half written.

59:12.680 --> 59:17.240
So we will see whether this book belongs to the category of published or never published

59:17.240 --> 59:19.960
book. But no, no, I do think that this book will.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.040
There are two reasons why you can write a book.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.840
You either write a book because you want to learn a topic or you write a book because you

59:26.840 --> 59:28.040
are an expert on the topic.

59:28.800 --> 59:34.600
I like very much, I think it's Vidya Sagar who once told me that if you want to learn

59:34.600 --> 59:36.520
about a topic, write a book on that topic.

59:37.480 --> 59:42.280
There is no better way of learning than being forced to explaining concepts.

59:43.120 --> 59:48.360
And again, we go back here to the tension again between teaching and researching, which is

59:48.560 --> 59:50.240
very much intertwined, I would say.

59:51.240 --> 59:54.280
I guess this is a good time to shift gears a little bit.

59:54.320 --> 59:58.200
And I mean, there is a number of questions that I like to ask to our guests.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.480
But first, I would like to maybe dig into, I would say, something like that I would call a

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.040
double life almost that you lived.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:12.680
So you had time to explore optimization on manifolds in a book that potentially I think

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.360
it's your most cited publication so far.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.160
And I remember having a conversation with you where essentially you told me that it

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.960
started as a hobby, almost it started as something that a side project, is that fair to

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.960
say? I wouldn't say a side project, but I would say as a sort of, yeah, as a journey.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.600
So it is a side project, as you would decide to visit a country for a while and then come

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:42.320
back. And perhaps it's the first time in my career where I sort of venture into a

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:49.680
neighboring discipline because, yes, control is very much a science of optimization and a

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.800
science of feedback.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.680
But I think that optimization is not specific to controls.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:00.240
Optimization is somehow a driving paradigm in many disciplines.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.000
So also having ventured in optimization for a while and having come back to control, I now

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.080
consider that out of the two, feedback is really what is the distinctive feature of

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:19.760
control theory and that control theory exists as what it is because it addresses it.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:25.840
I think it's the only science in my view that really addressed the question of feedback at

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.680
its core. So venturing in neighboring disciplines showed me the value of traveling and

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.600
traveling abroad and learning another language and also appreciating how difficult it is

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.840
and how time consuming it is to learn the language of another community.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.360
I used that skill later on when I decided to venture in neuroscience.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.960
So it was sort of a first step.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:57.600
And then perhaps realizing that by moving to neighboring disciplines, you can potentially

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.400
contribute to the discipline in a very original way.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:09.160
Not necessarily being more clever than your peers, but having these different insights that

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.760
comes from the diversity I was talking before.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:19.480
And so, of course, I'm very glad of the success of optimization on manifolds a posteriori

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.520
because it was totally unexpected.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.120
And clearly working on that topic in the early 2000s was working on a very esoteric topic.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.560
And seeing that now this topic has become widespread in machine learning and computer

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:41.880
vision and is, of course, very rewarding and to me, encouraging about the value of

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.920
diversity, about the value of jumping in a neighboring community and saying, OK, this is

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.160
what matters in my field.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.800
Do you think it might be of relevance in your field as well?

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.000
And in that case, it was the role of invariance.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:03.680
You know, we put a lot of attention to invariance properties when we do physical

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.680
modeling in control and the geometric thinking in control is very much rooted in an

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.960
effort to formulate questions in a sort of coordinate free manner.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:21.080
And so in ways that are invariant as much as possible and approaching the design of

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:27.720
optimization algorithms with this particular angle was not common at all, certainly at the

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.800
time. And of course, it's of great relevance in a number of engineering disciplines where

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.920
let's say you want to computer vision algorithms to be invariance to the motion of the

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.280
camera or things like that.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.840
We can think of many problems where invariance are of tremendous importance.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:53.720
And yeah, to me, it was that's what I learned from my journey in optimization, that by

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.880
venturing in a neighboring field, well, first of all, it is very challenging because you

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.240
have to learn a new language.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:06.040
Second of all, perhaps the way you can contribute there is by using your own identity and

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.440
using the diversity that you are bringing in a different community.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:18.760
And so I became sort of more confident that indeed diversity is something very rewarding in

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.720
science and very important in science.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.240
Again, there's a lot of meat to unpack there.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.440
You're indirectly addressing one of the questions that I would have asked you before,

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.120
actually later about advice to future students, potentially.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.560
Another thing that you touched on that I think is important is the relevance of

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:44.800
conceptualizing almost in a representation free manner, if that makes sense.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:51.560
So that is something that is very much at the core of much of the research of Jan Willems in

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.480
the field of systems theory.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.600
So this is actually one of the questions that I wanted to ask you.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.200
And maybe then I'll try to close the loop on optimization of manifold.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.880
But would it be fair to say that he was one of the most inspiring figures for you?

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.080
And if you had to name three, who would they be?

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.120
I know it's a tough question and it will definitely be do injustice to some.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.560
Yeah, well.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.800
There is no question that Jan Willems would be one of the three and that I think it is his

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:28.320
research that has been perhaps most influential on my research in exactly what you were

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:36.240
saying in the importance of questions and the importance of formulating a question in a

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.600
mathematically precise.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:44.240
So this tension about picking your questions out of conceptual questions, like what is

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.720
positive feedback? It's a very conceptual question.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:53.200
But then turning that conceptual questions into something that becomes mathematically

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.840
precise. I think that the research of Jan Willems in that regard is really remarkable.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:05.560
And I have no doubt that it will be a longstanding heritage for the field for that reason.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:12.760
If I have to think of other names, well, clearly I would mention my mentor, who is Peter

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:17.920
Kokotowicz. And Peter Kokotowicz influenced me in a very different way than Jan Willems.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.360
It's not so much the research, I think, that influenced me, but the attitudes towards

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.960
research. And probably that today, when I have to make a decision about what to do, what not

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:36.040
to do, how to do something, the person that most frequently comes to mind is Peter

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.600
Kokotowicz. So what would have he done in this situation?

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.480
What would have been his advice?

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.480
And it is in that sense that I consider him as my mentor.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.120
He certainly taught me the value of history and the fact that you cannot understand the

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.120
concept until you have unfolded the history of that concept.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.720
I find this extremely important.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:04.600
In science, we often have a negative vision on history, on the whole of history.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.680
Oh, history is looking backwards.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.520
Science should look forward.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:16.160
And, yeah, I do think that the best way to look forward is first to look in the past

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:22.680
what is useful to move forward and take heritage of what was known in the past.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.360
A third name, I'm afraid would not be a name, but I would like to mention here really the

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.880
role of my students and postdocs, including you, Alberto, because I think that and I

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.800
mentioned that earlier, that in those conversations that make you realize that you

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:46.560
didn't formulate clearly what you thought you were formulating clearly, those

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.680
conversations are the motor of my research.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.600
And those conversations can, of course, happen with colleagues and with anyone.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.840
But nothing replaces the role of students and postdocs in my experience in that

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.480
journey. So because with a postdoc or with a PhD student, you develop a sort of a

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.560
relationship over a number of years.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.200
And so this conversation over time becomes very intimate.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:20.280
And really pushes you to the heart of the matter in a way that is unmatched, I think.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:27.240
So, again, the value of teaching and mentoring as the motor of research, it is

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.600
something that is very much part of my identity, I think.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.040
That's fantastic.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.120
Again, you keep on serving me assists about how to proceed forward, and it's always

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.920
difficult to choose because there's so many avenues that are interesting.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.280
So I mentioned earlier that I wanted to close the loop with optimization of manifolds.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.840
And we mentioned the value of history as well.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.680
So I think this is a good time to ask the question of pondering about the past, the

01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:01.080
present and the future of our field and of the fields you ventured into, if you have

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.240
any thoughts.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.520
So I guess the question could be phrased as what are you most excited about in the years

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.680
to come? What are the technologies that we should look for?

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.040
And yeah, what are the questions maybe that systems and control theory should address?

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.680
OK, I think that it's probably clear from what I discussed before, I'm very excited by

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.600
the role of cybernetics right after the Second World War.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:34.240
I'm very puzzled by the fact that this period was so short lived and that somehow the

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:40.080
publication of the book Cybernetics was the end of the cybernetics age because of

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.960
information theory and because of the invention of the computer that put an end somehow to

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.640
the needs of thinking of machines and animals in the same framework.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.960
I think we are returning to the cybernetics questions and I think that this will occupy a

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.280
lot of researchers, not just in control, but also in control in the future.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.680
I think that we have reached a stage where we see the limitations of machine learning.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.800
We have reached a stage where we see the limitations of digital technology and we see

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:22.120
that the limitations of those two extremely successful developments of the second half of

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:29.880
the 20th century, that the limitations of those technologies come from the uncertainty

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.960
and come from the difficulty of handling and coping with uncertainty.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.520
So this is a perfect age for control.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:46.400
And I think that control will have, in my view, control has a very glorious future ahead.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.280
First of all, because it's a very young science.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:56.000
I keep thinking that control became science after the Second World War.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.400
So it's very recently.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.280
And that success of control is really designed under uncertainty, as I've said before.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:09.640
And we have no shortage of engineering and technological challenges where we have to cope

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.520
with uncertainty.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.760
But of course, we have to pay attention to what is happening and we have to pay attention to

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.160
how we can contribute to what is happening.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.680
And in that regard, I have come to regard the question of feedback as really the core

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.240
question of control theory.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.440
And I think that nowadays, perhaps a lot of research in our community has moved away from

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:39.000
the core question of feedback, has also perhaps moved away from the question of uncertainty

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:45.320
because of the prevalence of optimisation and machine learning and the fascination of what

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.040
you can do with the digital computation.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.080
And again, don't take me wrong.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.400
It's not that I would want to campaign against that, but it is that I think that the future

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:05.280
of control is in identifying that the way we can contribute to this field and to engineering

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.520
in general is really by our unique way of approaching the question of uncertainty and how

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:19.760
we cope with uncertainty and how we can, thanks to feedback, turn very uncertain devices

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.120
into certain functions.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:29.200
This is a very fascinating picture of the future in a way, which, again, keeps on serving me

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.080
answers about questions that I have for you.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.640
And one that I tend to ask to every guest here is about advice to future generations.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:43.920
So if the question could be phrased as like, what are the most important traits that

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.560
successful researcher in our field should have?

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:53.400
Or is there anything that you wish you knew something about, say, when you started your

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.080
career? What sort of advice could you give to future students in control?

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.080
It's a very open ended question and it could be also like, what should they invest on, for

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:03.560
example?

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:10.240
Right. Perhaps what I would answer, it's not so much the what that matters, but the how

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200
and the why.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:22.120
And so I think you can, at least for a long, even in the PhD, there is this tension between

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.280
research and education.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:31.400
You do a PhD, I often tell my students, maybe I told you that before, what I learned in

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.080
my PhD is how not to do research.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.360
And perhaps this is the most important skill that you need to develop at an early stage

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:46.080
of your career, because everyone starts research with the ambition of, you know, solving

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.920
new questions, identifying the important questions.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:57.000
And but what you learn by doing research is that the difficulty is not to find difficult

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
questions. There are plenty.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.480
The difficulty is to respond.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:09.280
The difficulty is to resonate with a question of your time and to develop skills that

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:16.520
eventually will give you a competitive advantage or a unique angle of attack to address

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.920
some questions. And that happens, again, as in the same way as I was talking about the

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.720
trajectory, that happens through a sequence of events.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.720
And I think that the events themselves are not that important.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.560
It's really that you have to learn how you respond to events and you have to find your

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.080
own identity in the way you respond to events.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.720
And, yeah, of course, ultimately, the advice comes from Socrata, Knotis Eotan, once if

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.480
you know yourself, if you know your limitation, if you know what you can do well, you will

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:54.520
do well. And perhaps that's that's the most important question that we need to learn at

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.400
an early stage of our career is to try to learn something about ourselves.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:07.480
Maybe the last question I have before closing this episode relates to something that I am

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.160
thinking about a lot these days, and that's the concept of creativity.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.200
I think you're one of the most creative persons I've met so far in my life.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.520
And so I have a question for you.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.120
I mean, I'll start with maybe a quote from David Bohm.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.480
David Bohm is writing the following in wholeness and the implicate order.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.800
He writes, one prerequisite of originality is clearly that a person shall not be inclined

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.120
to impose his preconceptions on the fact as he sees it.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.680
Rather, he must be able to learn something new, even if it means that the ideas and the

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.920
notions that are comfortable or dear to him may be overturned.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.000
And this is something that seems to very much resonate with what you were mentioning

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.320
before. So I guess the question would be here.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.680
Is there anything, any sort of advice that you can give to generate creativity?

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.560
Well, you are very generous, and I'm not sure I would identify myself as someone

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.000
particularly creative, but I love this quote of Daniel Barenboim, who is a great

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.760
pianist, and he says music teaches us the difference between freedom and anarchy.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:25.520
And I think that scientific creativity, very much like creativity in art, is a very

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.680
fine balance between constraints and imagination.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.800
And it seems to me, but perhaps this is personal, that it is the most constrained

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.560
type of art that leads to the biggest creativity.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.720
So, for instance, I don't think there is a stronger illustration of that than the

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:52.760
music of Bach. The music of Bach is almost mathematical in a way, in the sense that it

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.560
obeys such strict rules.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:03.360
How comes that throughout centuries it generates so much emotion, including in

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:08.520
people who have no musical education, who don't know about the constraints?

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:15.000
And I think that in our field, again, we are back to the fact that control is at the

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.400
same time a very mathematical science, but a science of something very concrete.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.800
So I think that the best creativity that I see in control is the one very much

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.480
constrained by mathematics and by the rules of mathematics.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:37.720
And how you find a place for novel, for innovation in those rules is a bit of a

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.080
mystery. And this is where the concreteness of the environment plays its role.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:51.120
So the pianist who creates emotion from a piece of Bach might create emotion today and

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.640
totally fail tomorrow.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.400
He might create emotion in you today, not in me and tomorrow in me and not in you.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.560
So it's always about, and I think pianists would tell us that it's about a resonance

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.600
with the public. This resonance is really two sided.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.560
It's not one side.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.640
So you don't have entire control on it.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.720
But you are the one who know the constraints, who have to operate under the

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:22.080
constraints. And somehow by acknowledging that those constraints are a prerequisite

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:29.120
for emotion and for that will happen in a somewhat uncontrolled way.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.560
Perhaps I would think that this is a very important, at least part of creativity.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.280
So creativity is much more than that.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:43.240
But it is an element of creativity that has always fascinated me because I find that

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.400
research in control is very constrained.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.240
You know, sorry to again talk about feedback.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:57.720
I cannot help. But constraining a concept like feedback with mathematics seems like

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.400
you are. Why do you do that?

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.840
What is the value of constraining such a beautiful concept with the rules of logics?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.920
And that is exactly the mystery of science and art.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.880
I think that it is because the concept is not enough.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.080
It is the communication of the concept that is as important as the concept.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.760
And the communication uses those constraints.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:33.360
So communication in science uses mathematics as a channel.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:41.480
And this channel is indispensable to communicate and to exchange about the concept of

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.920
feedback that creates emotion in you and me.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:48.760
But definitely a different one in you and different in me.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.600
And if we don't have this mathematical language, we never know whether what we express

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:03.720
about the concept is indeed resonating with what your interlocutor thinks of the

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.000
concept. Sorry if this is too long of an answer.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.480
It's absolutely not. I mean, it's very much resonating with, I guess, with Galileo.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.120
So the world is written in the language of the universe is mathematics.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.880
Since we're talking about creativity, I mean, there is abundant evidence that shows that

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.000
one thing that seems to stimulate creativity is walking.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:30.400
And I know you're an incredibly avid hiker.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.520
So in closing the episode, I thought it would be nice to ask you what is on your to-do list

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.080
there? Like, is there anything that you have planned?

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.720
Well, there the list is too long to be closed in one lifetime.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:48.680
So I hope my legs can bring me to a lot of new paths.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:54.520
I must say that and perhaps this has been a consequence of the pandemics that I've

01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:00.640
discovered that walking 10 miles from home can create the same emotion as walking on

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.760
the other side of the planet.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:11.040
So maybe, you know, when I was younger, my to-do list includes a very famous treks and

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.280
very challenging ones.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:19.680
But I've come to appreciate that it is the activity of walking that is wonderful and

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.120
that very often and certainly in my case, I'm lucky that I don't have to walk very far

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.840
from home to find wonderful landscapes and to enjoy walking.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:38.280
So I hope I will walk as much as possible and in the future and for as long as

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:43.560
possible. But I don't care too much where I will walk, to be honest.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:50.720
But definitely, I agree that there is something quite fascinating about walking, also

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.760
for a control engineer, because we try to build walking machines.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:04.400
And I also wrote an editorial about rhythm recently and rhythm are definitely a very,

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.160
very important aspect of animal machines.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.680
And walking is a very important activity.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:16.040
And I recently heard a very, very interesting conversation on the team of walking

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.080
between philosopher and a neurophysiologist.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.600
And so the question was, is walking thinking or is thinking walking?

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:30.600
That resonates a lot with me as well, that certainly most of my thinking is while

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.480
walking in my personal experience.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.520
But it is also a fact, and this was the point of the neurologist, that in fact, the more

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.960
we study the brain, the more we tend to think of the activity of thinking very much as

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:51.360
we think of the activity of walking and of, in fact, any other rhythmic activity of the

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:58.360
body. So the rhythmic nature of thinking, I think, is of great importance and again, a

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.480
natural place for control.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.160
Yeah, so again, this is super fascinating in what we just mentioned is very much

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:11.680
resonating with one of your latest editorials, Clocks and Rhythms, again on IEEE

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.840
Control Magazine. There will be a link in the description.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.760
Unfortunately, we are at the end of our episode.
