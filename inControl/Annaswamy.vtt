Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

00:10.480 --> 00:21.240
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.040
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from our recording studio in Lausanne.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.540
Again we're here in the beautiful French speaking side of Switzerland for a nice event which

00:29.540 --> 00:33.980
brought together some of the most brilliant minds out there in control and machine learning.

00:33.980 --> 00:39.900
Today our guest is Anu Anaswamy, Director of the Active and Adaptive Control Laboratory

00:39.900 --> 00:44.340
and Senior Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Department

00:44.340 --> 00:46.180
of Mechanical Engineering.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.340
Welcome to the show Anu.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.340
It's my pleasure.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.620
Thanks for having me.

00:49.620 --> 00:53.360
Just before I forget, quick thanks to our sponsors as well to the National Center of

00:53.360 --> 00:58.480
Competence in Research on Dependable Ubiquitous Automation as well as the International Federation

00:58.480 --> 01:00.060
of Automatic Control.

01:00.060 --> 01:08.340
Anu, just to break the ice, what do the first 60 minutes of your day look like?

01:08.340 --> 01:14.340
Ah, well, emails I think.

01:14.340 --> 01:21.260
There's always something very interesting and informative and surprises that sort of

01:21.260 --> 01:22.860
set the day.

01:22.860 --> 01:29.040
And you know, with everybody working around the clock on controls research, colleagues

01:29.040 --> 01:35.280
in Europe have been up for, say for instance, six hours before me and they tell me what's

01:35.280 --> 01:40.120
been going on and that sets the day and, you know, there are then discussions and meetings

01:40.120 --> 01:41.120
and all that.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.680
And so that's basically every 60 minutes of my day start with.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.120
Are you the kind of person that likes, say, to do, I don't know, physical exercise or

01:50.300 --> 01:52.820
meditation or anything like that?

01:52.820 --> 01:55.980
Yeah, I do do them, but later in the day.

01:55.980 --> 02:01.580
But I'd like to start, you know, have my cup of coffee and just jump into work.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.940
And of course, these days, there's always Wordle that starts the day.

02:05.940 --> 02:06.940
Who isn't doing that?

02:06.940 --> 02:07.940
Right.

02:07.940 --> 02:09.180
And then, of course, email.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.220
And that's how my day begins.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.220
Yes.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.220
Yeah.

02:13.220 --> 02:18.340
So maybe, you know, shifting towards the topic of today, which hopefully will be adaptive

02:18.360 --> 02:25.240
control, which is an area of expertise of yours and also its history, I would like to

02:25.240 --> 02:29.360
maybe ask you what has drawn you to control in the first place?

02:29.360 --> 02:35.240
So I know that reading your biography, I saw that you have not just one, but two undergraduate

02:35.240 --> 02:36.240
degrees.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.240
Is that right?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.240
That is correct.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.240
Okay.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.520
And so, yeah, I was curious, given that you have this broad span, what has drawn you to

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
control?

02:45.520 --> 02:46.520
Okay.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Yeah, no, I'd be very happy to answer that.

02:47.700 --> 02:53.060
So, as you mentioned, I have two undergraduate degrees, and the first one was in math.

02:53.060 --> 03:00.580
And what I found towards the end of that education is that I wanted to really move towards a

03:00.580 --> 03:02.700
more applied aspect of math.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.260
So this was all fine, and I loved doing what I was doing there, but I wanted to know what

03:07.260 --> 03:08.520
it was all for.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.980
So that drew me to my second degree, which was in engineering.

03:11.980 --> 03:15.340
And there was a very specific program where only graduates were admitted.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.360
So it was sort of like a graduate program almost, except that it was more abridged than

03:20.360 --> 03:27.160
the usual undergraduate degree in engineering in India, which is where I come from.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.080
Was five years at that time.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.800
And so this one was more abbreviated in three years, because you've taken all of your courses

03:32.800 --> 03:35.280
already, and that was in electrical engineering.

03:35.280 --> 03:41.400
And so, but even there, what I found was here were all these different courses that mentioned

03:41.400 --> 03:44.320
as to how the universe worked, which was great.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.780
And then was this controls course, which said, no, no, this is basically how you can modify

03:48.780 --> 03:49.780
the universe.

03:49.780 --> 03:52.700
And I thought, wow, that's really cool.

03:52.700 --> 03:56.740
And I got into that more, and the rest is history, I guess.

03:56.740 --> 04:01.900
So I've been working in that same area, I've never left school.

04:01.900 --> 04:06.100
And I still feel that every day I have something to learn.

04:06.100 --> 04:10.660
And then, you know, like I said earlier, what happens in the first 60 minutes, I can't wait

04:10.680 --> 04:16.560
to see what the day brings in terms of new opportunities, new challenges and controls,

04:16.560 --> 04:19.760
research and new solutions.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.160
And yeah.

04:21.160 --> 04:27.440
And but from India, and then you moved to the US to Boston.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.680
So what has brought you on the other side, I would say?

04:30.680 --> 04:34.280
So I applied to graduate school.

04:34.280 --> 04:39.460
And so there were obviously lots of opportunities in the United States.

04:39.460 --> 04:45.340
And it so happened that I met who would become my future advisor, Professor Narendra, who's

04:45.340 --> 04:47.100
also originally from India.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.820
And it so happened, serendipitously, that he was visiting his parents, who happened

04:51.820 --> 04:54.940
to be in the same city that I was from.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.820
And so, you know, I talked to him.

04:56.820 --> 05:00.980
And again, I found even during the, what, 30 minutes of conversation that we might had

05:00.980 --> 05:03.020
that I was learning so much.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.920
And so it was very clear to me that that's where I'd like to go.

05:05.920 --> 05:10.240
And so when Yale University offered me admission, I just took that.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.260
And so, so before Boston, that's New Haven, Connecticut.

05:14.260 --> 05:18.480
And that's where I did my PhD in adaptive control.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.480
Okay.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.480
Yeah.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.720
So this is actually a good assist for me to ask you, what is adaptive control or even

05:26.720 --> 05:27.800
what is adaptation?

05:27.800 --> 05:33.180
So before we delve into this topic, I think I should mention that, well, you wrote one

05:33.180 --> 05:35.940
of the Bibles of adaptive control.

05:35.940 --> 05:41.300
And I do suggest to everyone in the audience to check out the first chapter of the book

05:41.300 --> 05:47.380
Stable Adaptive Systems by Anu and Professor Narendra, because there is a really fantastic

05:47.380 --> 05:51.220
section about how to even define adaptation.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.500
And it seemed absolutely non-obvious when the whole field started.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.300
So maybe you can tell us a bit more about that.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.300
Absolutely.

05:58.420 --> 06:04.420
So adaptation is exactly what the English word means, it's, you know, as it is defined

06:04.420 --> 06:11.100
in biology, advantageous confirmation of an organism to changes in its environment.

06:11.100 --> 06:15.380
So interestingly enough, and I don't know if this was quite your question, but let me

06:15.380 --> 06:18.860
answer if it's a different question, then apologies.

06:18.860 --> 06:26.100
So in adaptation, that concept is the one that caught the imagination of a lot of flight

06:26.100 --> 06:28.820
control engineers and admirals.

06:28.820 --> 06:36.060
And so what they really wanted to do was to design systems, design controllers that figured

06:36.060 --> 06:37.420
on the fly.

06:37.420 --> 06:43.020
And again, the emphasis is on the fly, meaning in real time, as to how to adjust its structure

06:43.020 --> 06:48.340
so that it adapted to changes in the environment and corrected itself and behaved.

06:48.340 --> 06:55.900
So even before theory, adaptive control theory came into being, adaptive control practice

06:55.900 --> 06:57.940
was already there.

06:57.940 --> 07:02.580
So it's one of those interesting cases where practice was ahead of theory.

07:02.580 --> 07:10.500
And so there was this one specific hypersonics program called X-15, where the different control

07:10.500 --> 07:16.100
loops that they had, they chose to make one of them adaptive.

07:16.100 --> 07:22.140
And they actually had several successful flights where the notion of adaptation was basically

07:22.220 --> 07:29.020
in the form of control gains in the feedback loop that basically toggled between two different

07:29.020 --> 07:30.300
values.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.980
And they did that on the basis of what they were measuring.

07:32.980 --> 07:39.620
So in some sense, an exact manifestation of advantageous changes in the organism in response

07:39.620 --> 07:41.580
to changes in the environment.

07:41.580 --> 07:45.860
And they had several successful flights that basically did that.

07:45.860 --> 07:49.220
But then I'm sure we will get more into what happened next.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.100
Absolutely.

07:50.100 --> 07:56.220
That was really the idea behind adaptive control.

07:56.220 --> 08:04.500
And the symposia that were held on adaptive systems at that time tried to capture that

08:04.500 --> 08:07.060
essence in the definition of an adaptive system.

08:07.060 --> 08:13.340
So and then came lots of different efforts in trying to come to a very crisp and useful

08:13.340 --> 08:16.820
definition of adaptation and adaptive control.

08:16.820 --> 08:20.700
And that's what we tried to capture in that introduction.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.500
And one thing left to another.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.020
And then it sort of came to what we know as adaptive control now.

08:26.020 --> 08:27.500
But we can get into that later.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.140
Absolutely.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.820
So I'm glad you mentioned that.

08:29.820 --> 08:34.220
I mean, I guess the main motivation for the development of adaptive control and now we're

08:34.220 --> 08:39.420
talking about pretty much the 60s, I would say, or even before that, of course, we can

08:39.420 --> 08:44.180
trace it back to Norbert Wiener and we can even go probably even backwards.

08:44.220 --> 08:51.540
But I guess the 60s, between the 60s and the 65, is what is called the brave era of adaptive

08:51.540 --> 08:57.540
control. And really, it's fascinating to see how many concepts have been developed just

08:57.540 --> 09:00.020
in that five years span.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.500
So I don't know.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.660
Do you have any thoughts about the developments specifically in that time range?

09:07.540 --> 09:08.700
So, yes.

09:08.700 --> 09:15.220
So I mentioned the symposium, and that was a time when people were talking about and

09:15.220 --> 09:18.940
even implementing adaptive control in flight control.

09:18.940 --> 09:23.980
And around the same time is when the concept of state was being defined.

09:23.980 --> 09:29.060
And, you know, the seminal papers by Kallman, Miranda and Ho came at that time.

09:29.060 --> 09:34.020
And dynamic systems and control systems started to get codified around that around that

09:34.020 --> 09:34.980
time as well.

09:35.140 --> 09:41.660
And so people were beginning to understand how to implement the notions of feedback

09:41.660 --> 09:46.620
control and the methods by Black and Bode and Nyquist and understanding closed loop

09:46.620 --> 09:51.540
control system design using by analyzing forward loop and so on.

09:51.540 --> 09:57.420
So it's interesting to see, you know, that the history of feedback control is almost or

09:57.420 --> 10:02.660
rather the history of adaptive control systems has been as long as at least as long as

10:02.660 --> 10:09.300
the history of control systems, because it's very easy, just like feedback is such a

10:09.300 --> 10:16.620
fundamental and conceptually simple idea to understand and to get motivated by.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.100
So is adaptation.

10:18.100 --> 10:22.860
And so, in fact, you could argue that, you know, as you think about it at a very

10:22.860 --> 10:29.380
philosophical level, the idea of a feedback control system is not that far from the idea

10:29.380 --> 10:30.700
of an adaptive control system.

10:30.700 --> 10:38.140
So I would say those many of those fundamentals started to get defined around that time.

10:38.140 --> 10:41.620
But then I think we probably go towards the early 70s.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.460
If you want, I can get into into that.

10:44.460 --> 10:49.820
Yeah. So I would like to maybe add a few things about this brave era and then we can

10:49.820 --> 10:52.340
definitely move on to the 70s.

10:52.340 --> 10:57.700
So what I personally found fascinating was that there were incredibly influential people

10:57.700 --> 10:59.860
working in this specific time range.

10:59.860 --> 11:07.060
So between the let's say until the 1965, that we're focusing on adaptive systems.

11:07.060 --> 11:12.620
So we're talking about people of the caliber of not only Kalman and Bellman, but also

11:12.620 --> 11:18.820
Simon, who got a Nobel Memorial Prize in economic sciences in 78 for works on dynamic

11:18.820 --> 11:21.300
programming under uncertainty.

11:21.300 --> 11:27.020
And it is around this time that also the concept of dual control theory is being

11:27.020 --> 11:30.140
developed by Feldbaum in Soviet Union.

11:30.140 --> 11:36.860
And also Whittaker, I guess, is around this time that the famous MIT rule is developed.

11:36.860 --> 11:42.820
Maybe you can tell us something about that rule and also what led to, I don't know,

11:42.820 --> 11:45.180
the future developments in the 70s.

11:45.180 --> 11:50.940
Sure, sure. So let's go back to what we talked about as the concept of adaptation,

11:50.940 --> 11:55.140
right? Advantageous confirmation of an organism.

11:55.140 --> 11:59.700
So bring it to the context of a dynamic system.

11:59.700 --> 12:05.100
So here you have a dynamic system, which is the actual, say, aircraft or robot or process

12:05.100 --> 12:06.700
controller or what have you.

12:06.700 --> 12:10.740
And you are monitoring how it's performing.

12:10.740 --> 12:15.340
And then a controller is set in and set in place in closed loop.

12:15.340 --> 12:16.660
And then you design the controller.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.340
So that's what every feedback control system does.

12:19.380 --> 12:25.340
So now the advantageous confirmation here in the context of an adaptive control system

12:25.340 --> 12:34.420
is basically one where you are advantageously adjusting the control parameters in that

12:34.420 --> 12:39.020
control system. So imagine if you had a PID controller, then you're adjusting the PID

12:39.020 --> 12:44.940
gains because what you did at 10,000 feet might be very different from what happens at

12:44.940 --> 12:47.020
30,000 feet and so on.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.660
And so something like a hypersonics flight, which basically covers a large flight

12:51.660 --> 12:56.100
envelope, you do need to have that flexibility in adjusting yourself.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.700
So what do you do then?

12:57.700 --> 13:02.020
What is the response from the environment that you observe?

13:02.020 --> 13:05.300
Then you look at some sort of a performance quantity.

13:05.300 --> 13:09.500
So what we call these days as loss function.

13:09.500 --> 13:14.380
And so you then try to adjust your gains in a way so that you minimize that loss

13:14.380 --> 13:15.380
function.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.300
And so what do you do in order to do that?

13:17.300 --> 13:19.340
You look at something called the gradient.

13:19.340 --> 13:24.260
OK, all right, let's adjust the gains so that when I look at the gradient of this loss

13:24.260 --> 13:29.100
function, then that gives me the indication as to what direction should I adjust.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.700
Is it down or is it up?

13:30.700 --> 13:31.780
And by how much?

13:31.780 --> 13:33.980
And I designed it step size and so on.

13:33.980 --> 13:38.420
So all of those things were basically captured in the MIT rule.

13:38.460 --> 13:45.500
And so who, I mean, yeah, so who basically proposed that particular concept.

13:45.500 --> 13:50.740
So now in parallel, people were trying, beginning to understand about stability

13:50.740 --> 13:56.940
theory, about how to design control systems for systems with nonlinear dynamics.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.780
And so the whole notion of Lyapunov's direct method.

13:59.780 --> 14:04.660
And again, Kalman wrote the seminal paper of how to use that in the design of

14:04.660 --> 14:05.820
nonlinear control systems.

14:05.820 --> 14:12.740
So what people found out soon in the 70s was that this MIT rule, while it's great in

14:12.740 --> 14:16.260
many cases, it sometimes big falls short.

14:16.260 --> 14:21.580
And that is captured by basically tools from stability theory, which says that these

14:21.580 --> 14:26.580
gradient rules are things that do not actually not only not help you, but sometimes

14:26.580 --> 14:30.940
really hurt you because it can actually produce some instabilities if there is a

14:30.940 --> 14:36.180
latency between those performance functions you're measuring and the parameters.

14:36.180 --> 14:39.300
And some of those counter examples basically were brought in.

14:39.300 --> 14:46.340
And so that basically led to adaptive control theory, where you really need to look at

14:46.340 --> 14:51.100
two different kinds of measures and errors in the system.

14:51.100 --> 14:55.140
One is this loss function that you can actually measure, but the other is the

14:55.140 --> 14:58.180
parameters that you're trying to learn and adjust.

14:58.180 --> 15:04.140
And you need to worry about what kind of latencies basically are present between the

15:04.140 --> 15:06.460
time you measure and the time you adjust.

15:06.460 --> 15:11.700
And not all problems can be tackled by just using the gradient alone.

15:11.700 --> 15:17.500
So that basically was sort of the foundation of adaptive control theory.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.940
That's a fantastic way also.

15:19.940 --> 15:26.580
I mean, we talk about a fantastic way to move towards a transition between this brave

15:26.620 --> 15:31.740
era and the era of the 70s, where you mentioned that there is a prominent role of

15:31.740 --> 15:34.980
Lyapunov stability in adaptive control.

15:34.980 --> 15:39.660
We also talked about the fact that most of the research in the brave era was motivated

15:39.660 --> 15:41.900
by supersonic flights.

15:41.900 --> 15:47.900
And it is in this time that there are many successful flights, actually, that produce

15:47.900 --> 15:50.820
incredible results, I would say, in avionics.

15:50.820 --> 15:54.780
Maybe we can hear an excerpt of a video that is taken from those years.

15:54.820 --> 15:55.820
Of course.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.820
Yeah.

16:24.820 --> 16:28.820
The crew cameraman in one of the chase planes gets difficult and dramatic coverage of the

16:28.820 --> 16:30.820
smoothly executed landing.

16:37.820 --> 16:43.820
Crossfield is uninjured, but the X-15, one of three in the X-15 research program, sustains

16:43.820 --> 16:46.820
minor repairable damage.

16:46.820 --> 16:51.140
Crossfield checks his bird, which prior to this incident had made several successful

16:51.140 --> 16:54.180
glide and powered flights.

16:54.580 --> 16:58.780
Soon the X-15 will be released from contractor demonstrations, and research flights will

16:58.780 --> 17:04.180
begin by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the United States Air Force.

17:08.180 --> 17:14.300
So this excerpt testifies the success of adaptive control, I would say, in practice in the field

17:14.300 --> 17:16.020
of avionics.

17:16.020 --> 17:23.020
The problem is that in 1967, unfortunately, things didn't unfold so well in the test of

17:23.020 --> 17:27.100
a flight that Michael Adams was conducting for NASA, I believe.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.100
That's correct.

17:28.100 --> 17:33.140
He was testing the X-15-3 airplane.

17:33.140 --> 17:37.020
And yeah, unfortunately, things didn't go so well in that scenario.

17:37.020 --> 17:43.500
Michael Adams is known as the first American space mission fatality by the American convention.

17:43.500 --> 17:49.060
He was also the first qualified astronaut because he flew above 50 miles for some period

17:49.100 --> 17:54.100
of time before, unfortunately, his aircraft broke apart.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.500
And maybe we can dig into that.

17:55.500 --> 18:00.580
There is a delightful paper on the Control Systems magazine that you wrote about this

18:00.580 --> 18:01.580
accident.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.620
And I don't know.

18:02.620 --> 18:09.260
So what happened and what were the problems from the point of view of adaptive control?

18:09.260 --> 18:15.500
So I would certainly defer the details of what happened to the paper.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.700
So we do get into that in detail.

18:18.780 --> 18:25.340
But in a sense, what really happened was that there was a one of the there were several

18:25.340 --> 18:31.020
control loops that they had, one of which was had this adaptive capability where there

18:31.020 --> 18:39.260
was a control gain that toggled between two different values based on the content of the

18:39.260 --> 18:43.940
frequency content of a performance measure that they were looking at.

18:43.940 --> 18:48.780
And if depending upon the frequency content, it was either a smaller value or a larger

18:48.780 --> 18:50.460
value, I forget which.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.540
And that was the algorithm.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.300
So you see, in a sense, it's a very simple concept.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.060
I mean, the concept of adaptation is very simple.

18:58.060 --> 19:01.860
You want something and based on what you what you want, you adjust something.

19:01.860 --> 19:07.820
Now, you don't really if you if you're not aware of the complexity of what that means

19:07.820 --> 19:09.940
to the system, then you can get into trouble.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.460
And that's exactly what happened, because you see what you're doing is you're measuring

19:13.500 --> 19:16.060
something and then you're adjusting the parameter.

19:16.460 --> 19:22.020
Now, interestingly enough, I think this I should direct the discussion to Feldbaum's

19:22.020 --> 19:27.860
dual control. Now, what should that parameter be for a given environmental situation?

19:27.860 --> 19:32.740
So in order to really understand that and learn the parameters, you need to go into

19:32.740 --> 19:35.460
estimation. And now that takes infinite time.

19:35.740 --> 19:41.220
Now, in order to really make sure that your performance converges to the right value,

19:41.220 --> 19:42.420
that takes infinite time.

19:42.420 --> 19:47.820
That's control. Now, if you're trying to do both simultaneously, then you can get into

19:47.820 --> 19:53.100
trouble because you're trying to adjust the gains and based on the error and the error

19:53.100 --> 19:54.580
will depend upon the gains.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.740
And so there is a loop circularity here.

19:57.740 --> 20:03.580
And that's exactly what happened, because it turns out that what the situation was, was

20:03.580 --> 20:09.420
not something that really fell neatly into either use this value A1 or A2, but something

20:09.460 --> 20:14.780
else. And that's something that was whatever that new value was, was not learned by the

20:14.780 --> 20:20.300
controller. And because it didn't really learn that value properly, it led into basically

20:20.460 --> 20:23.820
instability because what you have now is a nonlinear control system.

20:24.260 --> 20:31.780
And that had a behavior which led to the closed loop system having unbounded solutions.

20:32.540 --> 20:38.660
So again, here was one where the control practice was way ahead of control theory.

20:38.860 --> 20:43.980
And the awareness that what you really have is a nonlinear control system and it has to

20:43.980 --> 20:47.060
be designed carefully was not there then.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.780
And that's basically what we dug into in the paper.

20:49.820 --> 20:54.780
We said, OK, let's now look at adaptive control because, you know, fast forward to what,

20:54.780 --> 20:57.340
2010 from 1967.

20:57.660 --> 21:02.980
Now we have this understanding of how you should define, design adaptive control

21:02.980 --> 21:08.980
systems, how you can deal with this concept of dual control, where you have this

21:09.260 --> 21:13.540
conflict between infinite time for estimation and infinite time for control.

21:13.940 --> 21:20.020
And you basically break that by introducing appropriate control structures that can make

21:20.020 --> 21:25.020
sure that your performance is well behaved and you have that under control before

21:25.100 --> 21:27.340
learning, before learning.

21:27.700 --> 21:33.340
So you do control first and then with hindsight, you learn the parameters.

21:33.620 --> 21:37.420
That basically is, in a sense, the foundation of adaptive control theory.

21:37.740 --> 21:44.700
It determines a solution to a dynamic system which has uncertainties in real time

21:45.020 --> 21:49.220
without having fully learned what the nonlinear system is.

21:49.580 --> 21:55.540
But what it does is it basically, even with imperfect learning, figures out what the

21:55.540 --> 22:00.180
control system ought to do and so that you can then have the performance in check.

22:00.740 --> 22:06.420
And so what we did in that paper is to basically lay that out and have a correct,

22:06.940 --> 22:08.980
provably correct adaptive controller.

22:09.300 --> 22:13.820
And then we compared it with what was actually implemented in the MH96, which is a

22:13.820 --> 22:16.540
Minneapolis Honeywell 96 controller.

22:16.660 --> 22:20.620
That was the name of that adaptive controller that they had in that fatal flight.

22:21.260 --> 22:25.100
And then we said, OK, let's start to try and compare apples with apples.

22:25.140 --> 22:31.540
And so we started to have a configuration where they looked identical except for, say,

22:31.740 --> 22:34.380
the change in the way in which the parameters were adapted.

22:34.820 --> 22:39.460
And so what we showed was that it was basically the way in which the parameters

22:39.460 --> 22:41.580
were adjusted was incorrect.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.980
And had they really, the awareness of what the overall control system is, had they

22:45.980 --> 22:51.500
done this adjustment according to this rule, then that flight would not have crashed.

22:51.740 --> 22:56.700
So it was a very satisfying experience because it was one of those things where we said,

22:56.700 --> 22:58.820
OK, this is basically what must have happened.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.420
And we were able to replicate that.

23:00.660 --> 23:04.420
And also we could play a what if scenario.

23:04.420 --> 23:09.180
If they had the awareness, this is basically what what they should have done, then

23:09.180 --> 23:10.460
Michael Adams would be here.

23:11.300 --> 23:14.420
I mean, you touched on so many interesting points.

23:15.020 --> 23:19.620
First of all, I want to make sure that the audience knows that there will be links in

23:19.620 --> 23:22.780
the description of this episode to all of the papers that we mentioned.

23:23.580 --> 23:29.940
We're also basing also our story today on a beautiful article written by Anu and

23:29.940 --> 23:32.580
Professor Fratkov on the history of adaptive control.

23:32.580 --> 23:35.020
There will be a link to that paper as well.

23:35.060 --> 23:40.180
There is also an upcoming paper, if I understand correctly, on the interplay between

23:40.180 --> 23:42.180
adaptive control and reinforcement learning.

23:42.940 --> 23:49.100
Yes, it'll appear in the annual reviews in Control Robotics and Automation Systems.

23:49.100 --> 23:52.740
And yeah, the title is exactly that adaptive control and intersections with

23:52.740 --> 23:53.580
reinforcement learning.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.660
There will be a link also to this paper as well.

23:55.660 --> 24:01.780
Of course, in discussing before we touched on, I would say, some very important

24:01.780 --> 24:06.980
points. So the first one that you were mentioning was dual control and essentially

24:06.980 --> 24:12.660
this tension between learning and controlling, which today is what we call the

24:12.660 --> 24:16.660
tradeoff between exploration versus exploitation.

24:16.980 --> 24:21.860
And also, I guess another thing that we should probably mention is that as a result

24:21.860 --> 24:28.620
of this crash, I guess funding was cut short for a short period of time for what

24:28.620 --> 24:30.140
concerns adaptive control.

24:30.140 --> 24:30.940
Is that correct?

24:30.940 --> 24:39.020
Yeah, so certainly people had to regroup and in the specific area of flight control,

24:39.460 --> 24:44.020
there was a pause and efforts to really understand what happened, efforts to

24:44.020 --> 24:49.540
understand control theory, efforts to understand a multivariable control theory.

24:49.740 --> 24:52.300
And so many of those things were set in motion.

24:52.300 --> 24:59.180
And even this whole effort to connect fundamental tenets of stability theory of

24:59.180 --> 25:03.300
nonlinear differential equations with adaptive control, because, you know, the

25:03.300 --> 25:08.260
recognition that what you really are doing when you start to adjust parameters of a

25:08.260 --> 25:13.580
controller in real time makes the whole problem one of a nonlinear time varying

25:13.580 --> 25:17.660
system, a system that is intentionally nonlinear.

25:17.660 --> 25:20.300
So then how do you design those nonlinearities?

25:20.300 --> 25:24.860
And so that's where there was a very elegant connection between adaptive control

25:24.860 --> 25:31.060
design and Lyapunov theory, because Lyapunov theory gives you that guideline as to

25:31.060 --> 25:35.580
how to design the controller such that you make something which is a positive

25:35.580 --> 25:37.820
definite function into a Lyapunov function.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.460
So some of those foundations were in place.

25:40.460 --> 25:45.700
The other very elegant result is it's not something that people talk about a whole

25:45.700 --> 25:50.580
lot these days, but again, in the 70s and the 80s, people explored that quite a bit,

25:50.580 --> 25:55.980
which is a notion of hyperstability and the notion of absolute stability, which

25:55.980 --> 26:01.260
basically is centered on passive systems and strictly passive operators.

26:01.540 --> 26:06.580
And so the whole idea is that if you have, even though they might be nonlinear, then

26:06.580 --> 26:10.740
if you have something which is a strictly passive operator in forward loop, then you

26:10.740 --> 26:16.660
can have several passive operators in feedback loop and structurally the system

26:16.660 --> 26:18.620
will be, will continue to be stable.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.900
So that's why it was called hyperstability.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.660
The notions of absolute stability also are connected with that.

26:24.660 --> 26:30.660
So people like Popov and Aizerman, many of those kinds of really very elegant

26:31.020 --> 26:36.340
stability theories of nonlinear dynamic systems were all sort of brought together.

26:36.540 --> 26:42.460
And this interplay again between parameter adaptation and feedback control were all in

26:42.460 --> 26:47.620
place. And, you know, so then over those two decades, the 70s and the 80s, with these

26:47.620 --> 26:52.980
foundations in place, and then there was another thing to saying, OK, if you really

26:52.980 --> 26:59.020
look at parametric uncertainties, then that gives you the foundation for how to set up

26:59.780 --> 27:00.940
adaptive control systems.

27:00.940 --> 27:06.580
But we also need to look at robustness to nonparametric uncertainties, which might be

27:06.580 --> 27:09.140
in the form of disturbances and model dynamics.

27:09.420 --> 27:15.420
And so I would say in the 90s, the foundations of robust adaptive control were in

27:15.420 --> 27:20.460
place. So this led to introducing terms, which we didn't call it as regularization

27:20.460 --> 27:25.300
then, but it's really ways of regularizing the underlying function, which is convex.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.620
And you really need to make it strongly convex.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.860
And that gives you the robustness.

27:30.100 --> 27:35.020
And that led to a whole bunch of methods based on dead zone, based on what is known as

27:35.020 --> 27:39.060
sigma modification, e-modification, parameter projection.

27:39.060 --> 27:44.020
And all those basically led to this is how you would design a robust adaptive control

27:44.020 --> 27:49.220
system. And so with that now, I say, you know, we should come full circle.

27:49.420 --> 27:55.860
And now coming into the 21st century, there's been actually several successful

27:55.860 --> 28:04.100
demonstrations of advanced flight vehicles with adaptive control, which are actually

28:04.100 --> 28:07.260
in production. And many of these things have been designed by Boeing.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.380
This is something that I didn't know.

28:10.780 --> 28:13.860
I mean, you touched again on so many interesting aspects.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.740
I would like to dissect them a little bit more, all of them, just because it's such a

28:17.740 --> 28:23.460
fascinating story. So again, maybe like moving on from this accident in the 70s, you

28:23.460 --> 28:26.660
mentioned that Lyapunov stability took over somehow.

28:26.660 --> 28:32.540
This is also the time just after 1967 is really the time of also the developments that

28:32.540 --> 28:34.820
led to going on to the moon, essentially.

28:35.260 --> 28:41.500
And so in between, let's say, the 70s and the 80s, stability really played a role.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.780
Lyapunov stability really played a role in adaptive control.

28:44.780 --> 28:50.860
And as you were mentioning, in moving forward towards the 80s, once you have a Lyapunov,

28:51.100 --> 28:56.740
let's say, set up, then it is immediate to ask also the question of robustness of these

28:56.740 --> 29:02.460
methods. Something else that I should mention also before, you know, essentially digging

29:02.460 --> 29:08.740
into this 70s and 80s period is that hyperstability and all of these concepts of

29:08.740 --> 29:11.820
absolute stability as well were coming from the Soviet Union.

29:12.660 --> 29:17.980
And I guess this was also the result of the competition between the US and the Soviets.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.220
I'm not sure about that.

29:19.780 --> 29:20.900
Yeah, you know, yeah.

29:21.180 --> 29:25.940
In fact, when we were writing this paper, Sasha Freitkopf and I were talking about

29:25.940 --> 29:33.100
exactly that, that there's been just so many rich developments, both in the Soviet

29:33.100 --> 29:35.660
Union and the and I guess the Western world.

29:35.980 --> 29:40.340
And many of those things actually happened independently and in parallel.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.260
And in some cases there was a confluence.

29:42.540 --> 29:47.340
So the other interesting place where a fundamental tool that was developed that's

29:47.340 --> 29:52.940
again used very much in adaptive control is what we call as the Kalman-Yakubovich

29:52.940 --> 29:57.020
lemma. And so right there in the name, you can see this sort of parallel development

29:57.020 --> 30:02.340
because separately Kalman and Yakubovich independently came up with this, which is, I

30:02.340 --> 30:09.020
think, one of the really beautiful results because it connects what happens in

30:09.620 --> 30:14.500
analysis in time domain with what happens in frequency domain.

30:14.780 --> 30:19.980
And there are not that many results that basically provide this connection between

30:19.980 --> 30:24.060
these two very different representations of dynamic systems.

30:24.500 --> 30:29.940
And so what they showed basically, and it's one of the central pillars of adaptive

30:29.940 --> 30:37.020
control, because it talks about what kind of performance functions can you use and

30:37.020 --> 30:42.620
adjust the parameters so that even when you don't have access to all of the states in

30:42.620 --> 30:47.060
the dynamic systems, even when the system is partially observable, you still are

30:47.060 --> 30:50.580
guaranteed to have the right adaptation laws.

30:51.380 --> 30:56.820
And so it turns out that the connection between the input-output property of the

30:56.820 --> 31:01.420
dynamic system is basically connected with the existence of a Lyapunov function.

31:01.420 --> 31:05.260
So on the one hand, this input-output stability property is the one in frequency

31:05.260 --> 31:11.620
domain. You can think of it as what kinds of characteristics should that obey in the

31:11.620 --> 31:16.700
frequency domain to the kind of operator that you need to have in time domain that

31:16.980 --> 31:20.340
allows a positive definite function to become a Lyapunov function.

31:20.740 --> 31:26.980
And that, too, is something that happened in the 70s and 80s and was a cornerstone in

31:26.980 --> 31:28.460
the development of adaptive control.

31:29.140 --> 31:35.420
And I would say that the paradigms around those times were essentially two in

31:35.420 --> 31:40.820
adaptive control, model-reference adaptive control, possibly, and self-tuning control.

31:40.820 --> 31:43.940
Can you tell us a bit about the difference of these two paradigms?

31:43.940 --> 31:51.100
Of course, yeah. So you can approach the whole problem by saying, OK, my focus is

31:51.100 --> 31:53.820
really that I want to control the system.

31:54.460 --> 32:00.300
And so at the end of the day, I really don't need to know how a system behaves.

32:00.380 --> 32:05.620
I just need to figure out what I need to do in order to get the performance I want.

32:06.020 --> 32:10.300
So model-reference adaptive control pursued that kind of what we would call as a

32:10.300 --> 32:12.340
direct adaptive control strategy.

32:12.940 --> 32:18.140
Now, on the other hand, if you say, OK, here is a dynamic system, I know how to

32:18.140 --> 32:22.660
control it. But then for whatever reason, something changed in the environment.

32:22.660 --> 32:24.860
And so my parameters have changed.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.260
So now what do I do?

32:27.140 --> 32:32.100
You can look at it completely from the point of view of estimation.

32:32.540 --> 32:37.780
So let's first identify the parameters and then design the controller.

32:38.340 --> 32:44.180
And so this is an explicit estimation, but you can call it as an indirect adaptive

32:44.180 --> 32:48.900
control because first you identify the parameters, then you identify the

32:48.900 --> 32:55.860
controllers. So if you take the notion of separation principle, which is very

32:55.860 --> 33:01.780
elegant and it says, you know what, you don't necessarily need to have observer

33:01.780 --> 33:06.140
design and controller design to, you know, we don't have to worry about the fact

33:06.140 --> 33:08.940
that they are two different steps.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.860
You can actually separate it and have both of them function in parallel and

33:12.860 --> 33:14.220
everything would work out fine.

33:14.220 --> 33:19.140
So the idea was then that, hey, I have this cost function and this cost function

33:19.140 --> 33:22.700
is a regular linear quadratic, you know, it's a quadratic cost.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.540
And so I will optimize this cost.

33:25.580 --> 33:29.900
I will try to come up with a regulator that basically self-tunes itself and

33:29.980 --> 33:31.300
optimizes this cost.

33:31.700 --> 33:36.420
So and I do that by saying, OK, I can estimate the parameters and then basically

33:36.420 --> 33:41.460
use the estimates in the cost function and have that be minimized.

33:41.660 --> 33:46.420
So that was the philosophy taken in the self-tuning regulators.

33:46.780 --> 33:49.420
So and those were the two parallel streams.

33:49.420 --> 33:54.500
And it turned out that if you're going to ensure that even as you're estimating

33:54.580 --> 34:00.340
the cost function is something that remains well behaved, you had to impose

34:00.340 --> 34:03.060
a certain structure to the problem.

34:03.140 --> 34:07.820
And it turned out that some of the assumptions that were made were basically

34:07.820 --> 34:12.020
exactly the same things that you needed to do in order to have the model

34:12.020 --> 34:13.900
reference adaptive controller at B's table.

34:13.900 --> 34:17.540
And so there were a lot of papers written again, I think, towards the end of

34:17.540 --> 34:24.140
the 80s that talked about a unified theory and the similarities between STR

34:24.140 --> 34:25.620
and MRAC and so on.

34:25.940 --> 34:30.220
But you see, it again goes back to the same thing that we talked about earlier

34:30.220 --> 34:33.140
in our conversation, which is this dual control.

34:34.460 --> 34:38.900
Since estimation and control are duals of each other, you really need to have

34:39.180 --> 34:45.100
the right structures for the controller so that even without full estimation,

34:45.100 --> 34:46.500
you can make the controller work.

34:46.500 --> 34:51.100
And at the same time, you also allow those structures to lead to learning of

34:51.100 --> 34:55.500
the parameters, to estimation of the parameters, so that eventually when this

34:55.500 --> 34:59.900
all really is done, after control is completed, after regulation is completed,

35:00.260 --> 35:05.620
you can use what is known as persistent excitation properties of excitation of

35:05.620 --> 35:07.980
the external signals and learn the parameters.

35:08.180 --> 35:11.260
So that was the story behind STR and MRAC.

35:12.580 --> 35:16.420
Thanks for this super nice overview of the two approaches.

35:16.740 --> 35:21.420
Actually, this gives me a nice access to move from the 80s towards the 90s.

35:21.460 --> 35:26.860
This is also the time where I believe you had your PhD as well and where you landed

35:26.860 --> 35:32.180
a super nice paper, essentially, that awarded you the George Axelby Prize, one

35:32.180 --> 35:34.740
of the most important prizes in control theory.

35:35.500 --> 35:39.020
The title of the paper is Robust Adaptive Control in the Presence of Bounded

35:39.020 --> 35:43.300
Disturbances. And I just wanted to talk about this because you mentioned the notion

35:43.300 --> 35:44.700
of persistence of excitation.

35:44.700 --> 35:49.060
And in that paper, you actually show that that plays a fundamental role in adaptive

35:49.060 --> 35:49.820
control, right?

35:50.140 --> 35:50.540
Yes.

35:50.980 --> 35:53.460
So what is the message of the paper?

35:53.820 --> 36:00.020
Right. So we talked about what adaptation is, right?

36:00.180 --> 36:04.420
Advantageous confirmation of an organism now in response to changes in the

36:04.420 --> 36:07.140
environment. So that's very important.

36:07.340 --> 36:11.420
So what is it that you say is your performance function?

36:11.860 --> 36:16.660
So adaptation and even the manifestation of that in an adaptive control system is a

36:16.660 --> 36:17.740
very simple thing.

36:17.740 --> 36:22.300
It's a very — think of it as a very simple-minded entity, because what it's doing

36:22.300 --> 36:26.900
is, hey, here is the performance, here's the loss function, and here is the

36:26.900 --> 36:30.100
parameter. Adjust the parameter in the direction of the gradient.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.780
That minimizes that loss function.

36:32.580 --> 36:38.460
So if you use this framework, then it turns out that you can do very well in

36:38.460 --> 36:42.860
controlling the system and ultimately even estimating the system with persistent

36:42.860 --> 36:50.580
excitation, provided there is a certain kind of a structure in the environment.

36:51.140 --> 36:55.740
Now, if this environment is pristine and is well-behaved and ideal and the only

36:55.740 --> 36:59.220
uncertainty is parametric in nature, then what we are talking about would be

36:59.220 --> 37:04.420
correct. But you are only observing a performance quantity, right?

37:04.460 --> 37:05.380
A loss function.

37:05.660 --> 37:10.380
What if, unbeknownst to you, there were other forces at work, other non-parametric

37:10.460 --> 37:14.100
effects that basically was affecting the performance, and you didn't know that?

37:14.500 --> 37:21.020
So if that happens, then essentially you are trying to adjust the parameters in a

37:21.020 --> 37:26.500
direction that might make that performance well-behaved, but you might end up

37:26.900 --> 37:28.340
destroying something else.

37:28.500 --> 37:33.300
And that basically was what people were observing could happen in adaptive control

37:33.300 --> 37:36.620
systems. You can explain that in many different ways.

37:36.620 --> 37:40.460
I mentioned convexity and making it regularized and making it strongly convex.

37:40.460 --> 37:41.540
That's one way of looking at it.

37:41.540 --> 37:44.260
And the other way of looking at it is here is a convex function.

37:44.700 --> 37:50.300
Then instead of doing regularization, because it introduces other artifacts into

37:50.300 --> 37:54.620
the picture, what if I make it strongly convex by using the notion of persistent

37:54.620 --> 37:58.900
excitation? So that turns out is another way of really looking at the problem.

37:58.980 --> 38:04.020
So then it turns out that even when there are disturbances, this performance

38:04.020 --> 38:07.980
function that you're observing, this loss function that you're observing, can be

38:07.980 --> 38:10.500
utilized in order to keep things in check.

38:11.220 --> 38:16.540
The paper that, if you go back and read that paper written in 86, it really doesn't

38:16.540 --> 38:19.620
have any of the language that I'm using right now, but that's just another way of

38:19.620 --> 38:25.820
looking at it as to how the relation between persistent excitation and robustness

38:25.820 --> 38:28.380
manifests itself. You can think of it in another way.

38:28.820 --> 38:34.340
Nonlinear systems or differential equations are extraordinarily rich compared to

38:34.340 --> 38:35.620
linear differential equations.

38:35.820 --> 38:42.020
The notions that we have of what happens for the unforced system and what happens

38:42.020 --> 38:46.420
in the presence of external forcing inputs is very different between a linear

38:46.420 --> 38:47.820
system and a nonlinear system.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.540
And that basically is what is mentioned in the paper.

38:50.980 --> 38:56.300
If you take a system that is, so there is no external input and you've got a nice

38:56.460 --> 38:58.980
system that's uniformly asymptotically stable, right?

38:58.980 --> 39:02.500
The origin is uniformly asymptotically stable, meaning you shake it, everything

39:02.500 --> 39:03.620
will go back to the origin.

39:04.060 --> 39:07.700
Now you introduce exogenous inputs into the picture.

39:07.900 --> 39:11.540
We know from linear systems that if you have a situation like that, bounded input

39:11.540 --> 39:12.860
will produce a bounded output.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.340
Not so for nonlinear systems.

39:15.420 --> 39:21.060
There is a very nice paper by Varaya, De Sovere and Varaya, I think.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.260
Actually, I have to go back and check the authors.

39:23.420 --> 39:26.540
Certainly it's by De Sovere, maybe the co-author is not Varaya, but someone else

39:27.220 --> 39:31.780
who basically showed this very nice counter example where you have a uniformly

39:31.780 --> 39:34.180
asymptotically stable system.

39:34.540 --> 39:38.420
You put in a bounded input, not only does the output does not remain bounded, it

39:38.420 --> 39:39.180
actually blows up.

39:39.660 --> 39:44.980
So we were able to come up with a counter example very similar to that in the

39:44.980 --> 39:49.340
context of an adaptive control system, which basically showed that if you just

39:49.340 --> 39:53.300
had the simple gradient rule type of thing, and then you introduce a

39:53.300 --> 39:57.540
disturbance, you can actually prove, you can actually come up with a positive

39:57.540 --> 40:01.500
definite function and show that there is a bounded, there is a region, not bounded

40:01.500 --> 40:04.380
region, where if you start there, you will stay there forever.

40:04.380 --> 40:05.860
And it's an open invariant region.

40:05.860 --> 40:07.940
And so the trajectory, it actually blows up.

40:08.340 --> 40:12.940
So what it says is that things may not actually, it's not easy to show stability,

40:12.940 --> 40:14.860
but it actually becomes unstable.

40:15.460 --> 40:20.220
Fortunately, there was also a happy ending to that paper, which says that this

40:20.220 --> 40:22.860
might happen if you don't have enough persistent excitation.

40:23.140 --> 40:27.020
So not only do you need persistent excitation, but you need enough of it.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.820
So sort of a signal to noise ratio type of condition.

40:30.140 --> 40:33.660
And if that is satisfied, then you get bounded input, bounded output for

40:33.860 --> 40:38.020
nonlinear systems, which is why that paper, I think, is very special.

40:38.860 --> 40:44.220
Very quick comment about this, this fact that you mentioned on the level, if you

40:44.220 --> 40:48.180
want, of persistence of excitation, because from my very humble perspective, it

40:48.180 --> 40:53.180
seems that these notions are now coming back in vogue in these times, at least at

40:53.620 --> 40:55.380
major conferences in control.

40:56.020 --> 41:01.500
But yeah, as you mentioned, from the 80s to the 90s, we start moving our horizon, if

41:01.500 --> 41:06.140
you want, in adaptive control towards issues of robustness and nonlinear systems,

41:06.580 --> 41:11.980
essentially. So that's the way I read the history, at least of adaptive control.

41:12.540 --> 41:18.260
So I would like maybe to shift towards those years and maybe even with a look

41:18.260 --> 41:20.300
towards our current times.

41:20.660 --> 41:27.380
So what happened, let's say, between the 90s towards the 2000s and 2010s, maybe?

41:28.420 --> 41:32.900
Oh, there's, you know, it's hard to sort of single out any specific sort of

41:32.900 --> 41:37.140
direction. So just like, you know, in general, what happened in the rest of the

41:37.140 --> 41:43.700
control systems branches, adaptive control tools started looking at nonlinear

41:43.700 --> 41:49.380
systems, different kinds of nonlinearities, multivariable systems, distributed

41:49.380 --> 41:54.780
adaptive controllers, looking at what happens when there are time delays and what

41:54.780 --> 41:59.780
happens when you're trying to implement adaptive control in cyber-physical systems

41:59.820 --> 42:06.660
and what's the right way to allocate the computation to different kinds of

42:07.180 --> 42:09.900
components in a real-time embedded system.

42:10.740 --> 42:16.580
And of course, you know, applications, what exactly is the kind of uncertainties

42:17.340 --> 42:20.820
that are typically present in applications?

42:20.820 --> 42:25.860
For instance, in a flight controller, you say, OK, here is a system dynamics, even

42:25.860 --> 42:29.020
though, let's say, XR equals AX plus BU, A and B are unknown.

42:29.460 --> 42:32.540
Let's parse that a little bit more carefully.

42:32.860 --> 42:36.100
What exactly is unknown in a dynamic system?

42:36.380 --> 42:41.180
Because it's not as if you know nothing about A and B and then you start designing

42:41.180 --> 42:43.220
K. There's a lot of information.

42:43.580 --> 42:48.420
And so one of the things that sort of, you know, came into, that people had better

42:48.420 --> 42:53.740
understanding of as time went on, for instance, you know, wind tunnel tests are

42:53.740 --> 42:59.740
things that are very carefully employed before designing a flight control system.

42:59.980 --> 43:03.860
So there's a lot of information in the dynamics.

43:03.860 --> 43:08.460
So based on, you know, aerodynamics, understanding of the equations of motion,

43:08.460 --> 43:15.100
conservation equations, and I'm putting it in a very simplified way, A is not really

43:15.100 --> 43:17.540
unknown. There's a lot of information in A.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.460
Now, on the other hand, B matrix, that's a very different story.

43:21.780 --> 43:25.740
It's not often that you know everything about it because it has to do with the way

43:25.740 --> 43:29.820
in which control surfaces interact with the aerodynamics.

43:30.100 --> 43:34.860
And not only that, control surfaces, you know, have many different components to it.

43:34.860 --> 43:39.020
From the time you actually have the information coming from your controller and

43:39.020 --> 43:44.340
then goes into the appropriate computational structures and then goes into this thing

43:44.340 --> 43:48.460
called the actuator and then the actuator basically provides, say, for instance, the

43:48.460 --> 43:51.780
control moments and forces, there's a lot that goes on.

43:51.980 --> 43:55.580
And in that whole chain of events, there can be a lot of uncertainty.

43:55.580 --> 43:57.780
So sometimes it's not that A is unknown.

43:57.980 --> 44:03.140
There are specific aspects to B, B times U, that basically can have uncertainty.

44:03.140 --> 44:07.700
So then you see, here you have this very generic theory, but then you have to

44:07.700 --> 44:11.100
systematically break it down and figure out how it should be applied.

44:11.100 --> 44:15.460
So many of those developments also happened as the years went by.

44:15.460 --> 44:19.940
So and then how do you actually, you know, scale the whole problem up?

44:19.940 --> 44:23.740
So one of the things that papers that we wrote was on a multivariable control

44:23.740 --> 44:28.860
system, which was for a very flexible aircraft, which had something like, oh, I

44:28.860 --> 44:36.620
don't know, 700 state variables and 33 control inputs and 300 or so outputs.

44:36.860 --> 44:40.580
And so, you know, that's then it had several parameters that we were adjusting

44:40.580 --> 44:43.060
and we showed that in real time you could do all of those things.

44:43.220 --> 44:47.540
So, you know, many of these kinds of developments, I would say, are probably

44:47.540 --> 44:51.460
what occupied the attention and is still occupying the attention of researchers

44:51.780 --> 44:53.260
in the adaptive control community.

44:54.020 --> 44:59.540
And maybe not to, of course, it will not be possible to cover everything in the

44:59.540 --> 45:01.940
span of just one hour or a little more.

45:03.020 --> 45:08.380
So we'll definitely do some injustice to some researchers in adaptive control.

45:08.780 --> 45:13.340
But something that I really want to touch on is the connection between adaptive

45:13.340 --> 45:18.460
control and essentially reinforcement learning or modern machine learning.

45:18.940 --> 45:23.740
I found in reading this beautiful history paper that you wrote together with

45:23.740 --> 45:29.100
Professor Fraktov, that there was an article by Richard Sutton, Andrew Bartow

45:29.100 --> 45:31.660
and Ronald Williams on the Control Systems Magazine.

45:32.020 --> 45:36.300
So literally speaking to a control audience where the title is literally

45:36.820 --> 45:39.980
reinforcement learning is direct adaptive optimal control.

45:40.580 --> 45:45.900
So I found it incredibly funny because they're now regarded as pioneers in the

45:45.900 --> 45:47.220
field of reinforcement learning.

45:47.260 --> 45:52.860
And they were telling us that what they're doing is direct adaptive optimal control.

45:53.820 --> 45:54.020
Yeah.

45:54.020 --> 45:59.660
So essentially in 2016, we all know that AlphaGo made a splash by beating Lee Sedol,

45:59.660 --> 46:01.460
the champion on the game of Go.

46:01.900 --> 46:05.660
And therefore there was a huge resurgence in interest, if you want, on

46:05.780 --> 46:06.660
reinforcement learning.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.860
What is the interplay now?

46:09.740 --> 46:10.780
What is the status?

46:11.660 --> 46:12.060
Right.

46:12.140 --> 46:19.740
Oh, that's a very hard question to answer in the time that we have.

46:20.300 --> 46:27.100
Again, just like the one I would certainly like to defer the listener to the recent

46:27.100 --> 46:33.100
article that I mentioned that will appear in the annual reviews, Controls, Robotics

46:33.100 --> 46:34.980
and Automation for details.

46:35.380 --> 46:40.500
But, you know, the two fields, reinforcement learning and adaptive control, have

46:40.660 --> 46:47.060
evolved differently with different tools and more importantly, different objectives.

46:47.780 --> 46:54.260
And the problems formulation statement in the two fields, they also vary.

46:54.380 --> 46:56.300
So what is adaptive control saying?

46:56.300 --> 47:00.420
Adaptive control is saying that I have a dynamic system.

47:00.580 --> 47:03.740
And right now, right now, there is an uncertainty.

47:03.780 --> 47:07.540
Or, you know, imagine again, let's consider a flight platform, right?

47:07.900 --> 47:09.020
A quadrotor.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.140
It's a drone.

47:10.340 --> 47:12.300
It's flying and it's in mid-flight.

47:12.940 --> 47:14.300
And then something goes wrong.

47:14.420 --> 47:15.500
It's in mid-flight.

47:15.580 --> 47:18.140
And then right now, in real time, something goes wrong.

47:18.900 --> 47:26.700
You don't have time to do experiments and do a lot of simulations.

47:27.100 --> 47:30.660
And, oh, what if I were to use this policy, then what would it do?

47:30.780 --> 47:32.220
You just don't have the time.

47:33.100 --> 47:39.460
And so you directly have to adapt and you have to figure out on the fly, what kind

47:39.460 --> 47:43.740
of thrust do I give to those motors in order to have it still do its thing,

47:43.740 --> 47:46.820
whatever it might be, hover, follow a particular flight path.

47:47.340 --> 47:52.060
So the emphasis is on coming up with a solution in real time.

47:52.540 --> 47:57.740
So because of that, adaptive control is geared towards what

47:57.740 --> 48:00.060
happened and what is happening.

48:00.060 --> 48:02.700
So it looks at the past and the present.

48:03.540 --> 48:08.700
Now, when you go into reinforcement learning, the trajectory there evolved

48:08.700 --> 48:10.900
from a point of view of optimality.

48:11.300 --> 48:16.460
So even let's take that, the game, the chess or a goal, you have to figure out

48:16.460 --> 48:22.420
what your policy is that needs to happen now and in the future.

48:22.460 --> 48:28.340
So you're looking at the present and the future, and you're trying to be optimal

48:28.380 --> 48:30.740
in terms of what the policy is that you're going to take so that

48:30.740 --> 48:31.940
you can beat your opponent.

48:32.420 --> 48:37.020
Now, you can see that distinctly, they have two different points of view.

48:38.060 --> 48:41.420
Past and present is really what you're looking at in adaptive control, simply

48:41.420 --> 48:43.100
because of the problem statement.

48:43.140 --> 48:47.300
And again, present and future is what you're looking at simply

48:47.300 --> 48:48.940
because of the problem statement.

48:49.220 --> 48:53.660
So necessarily they deployed different disparate tools in

48:53.660 --> 48:55.420
order to realize their objective.

48:56.100 --> 49:00.180
However, both of them have a common feature, which is that both of them are

49:00.180 --> 49:04.780
trying to deal with problems that have uncertainties in them.

49:05.060 --> 49:09.260
But it's just that when you go in and start unpacking it and go into the

49:09.260 --> 49:13.380
details, the statements that are being made and the tools that need to be

49:13.380 --> 49:15.380
employed start becoming different.

49:15.940 --> 49:23.180
And so this is why when you start to apply RL to problems in dynamic systems,

49:23.180 --> 49:28.820
which have uncertainties, I think one needs to be careful in figuring out what

49:28.820 --> 49:34.460
exactly are the different kinds of things that are under your disposal.

49:35.340 --> 49:41.780
If indeed you have time to make the decisions of exploration, then you have

49:41.780 --> 49:45.700
time before you start figuring out when you start your exploitation.

49:46.180 --> 49:48.380
Exploration here is parameter learning.

49:48.380 --> 49:50.180
Exploitation here is control.

49:50.180 --> 49:53.300
I mean, though, if you go into the details, I'm sure there are different

49:53.300 --> 49:56.580
shades and nuances, but for the sake of discussion, suppose you do that.

49:56.580 --> 50:00.340
Then if you're in real time, you don't have time to explore.

50:00.820 --> 50:03.540
You really have to control first before you can learn.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.740
So then control comes before learning.

50:06.300 --> 50:10.420
So those are the kinds of things where adaptive control and reinforcement

50:10.420 --> 50:14.900
learning differ and have different kinds of strengths and weaknesses.

50:15.460 --> 50:20.940
There's no question that there is a lot of tools that we can do in machine

50:20.940 --> 50:25.300
learning that help us deal with unstructured environments, large data

50:25.300 --> 50:27.540
sets, huge number of agents.

50:27.740 --> 50:33.460
So many of those lessons and successes that have been illustrated in algorithms,

50:33.940 --> 50:38.620
we should start to figure out how we can combine that with tools that

50:38.620 --> 50:39.820
are used in adaptive control.

50:39.820 --> 50:44.780
From the same point of view, adaptive control basically has lots of dos and

50:44.780 --> 50:48.500
don'ts for very good reasons, like, you know, this whole concept that we keep

50:48.500 --> 50:51.340
talking about of duality between estimation and control.

50:51.580 --> 50:53.820
Sometimes you have to put control before learning.

50:53.820 --> 50:57.380
You do control first and then you learn with hindsight.

50:58.020 --> 51:03.700
So you have to make sure that even when you have, there's sometimes you don't

51:03.700 --> 51:06.900
have enough information to have perfect learning.

51:06.900 --> 51:10.420
So in that case, you cannot do the indirect control.

51:10.420 --> 51:13.100
You cannot fully learn the parameters before you do control.

51:13.340 --> 51:18.220
And there's another thing about, you know, the title direct, adaptive, optimal

51:18.220 --> 51:21.180
control, that's very difficult to do.

51:21.300 --> 51:25.180
Again, because of what I said, which is what is difficult to do, adaptive

51:25.300 --> 51:27.540
and optimal at the same time.

51:27.940 --> 51:30.340
The reason is exactly because of what I said earlier.

51:30.780 --> 51:35.220
You, you are now looking at the past and the present, and you need to fix that

51:35.220 --> 51:37.620
first before you can start looking into the future.

51:38.020 --> 51:41.260
So I firmly believe, and that's one of the things that I think is mentioned in

51:41.260 --> 51:47.700
the paper, that is this sort of adapt, learn, optimize triad that I think we

51:47.700 --> 51:48.580
need to think about.

51:48.620 --> 51:52.020
So first you adapt, then you learn with hindsight.

51:52.060 --> 51:54.820
And then now that you've learned, you go ahead and optimize.

51:55.180 --> 51:58.500
And that kind of a sequence sometimes is inevitable.

51:59.260 --> 52:00.540
That's fantastic point of view.

52:00.540 --> 52:01.180
Fantastic.

52:01.780 --> 52:06.860
Um, essentially in the last few moments, you also addressed one of the questions

52:06.860 --> 52:11.540
that I wanted to ask you, which was what can the two fields teach to one another?

52:11.540 --> 52:12.580
So I'll ask you another one.

52:13.060 --> 52:16.820
And that's, what are you most excited about for the years to come?

52:17.020 --> 52:22.180
Uh, how do you envision say emerging worlds like those of machine learning

52:22.180 --> 52:28.100
where now we're really heading towards, uh, from translating speech into actions

52:28.100 --> 52:32.940
or speech into images and the world of, uh, adaptive control.

52:33.340 --> 52:34.380
Uh, what, what do you see?

52:34.580 --> 52:36.860
Oh, I think we've just scratched the surface.

52:36.860 --> 52:38.540
There's just so much to do.

52:38.860 --> 52:43.060
And I hope that the younger, younger generation will continue to do that

52:43.380 --> 52:47.860
because I, I don't know how much more time I'll, I'll have myself to continue

52:47.860 --> 52:49.620
to, you know, chip away at this.

52:50.020 --> 52:56.340
I mean, computationally the world has changed so much, even, you know, over

52:56.340 --> 53:01.980
the last, uh, 20 years, what we used to think of as, uh, methods that are, oh

53:01.980 --> 53:06.900
my God, that's going to be impossible to do are now not just possible.

53:06.980 --> 53:07.980
It's a cakewalk.

53:08.460 --> 53:15.100
So that kind of a, sort of a breakdown of the, the, the blinders that we used to put

53:15.100 --> 53:17.260
for ourselves, Oh, this is computationally.

53:17.340 --> 53:17.740
Okay.

53:17.740 --> 53:18.860
But this one, Oh, come on.

53:18.860 --> 53:23.140
That's never going to be possible is not, is that boundary is changing so much.

53:23.460 --> 53:27.700
I mean, still, I think there are some challenges in terms of, I mean, like for

53:27.700 --> 53:31.900
instance, why is adaptive MPC not here yet?

53:32.060 --> 53:36.820
Because even that as competent, uh, even with the computational resources, still,

53:37.180 --> 53:41.100
I don't think we are there to figure out how you can do the adaptation

53:41.260 --> 53:43.420
and optimization at the same time.

53:43.620 --> 53:48.220
So trying to figure out how you can leverage the kind of computational

53:48.220 --> 53:53.340
resources that you have in figuring out what needs to happen offline.

53:53.660 --> 53:56.860
And what needs to happen online is I think the challenge.

53:57.260 --> 54:00.420
How do you make sure that you address the sim to real gap?

54:00.860 --> 54:05.340
How do you make sure that you leverage all of the things that you learned

54:05.420 --> 54:10.580
offline and keep that, uh, transport them into an online construct?

54:10.980 --> 54:15.700
This interplay is, I think, becoming very complex.

54:15.780 --> 54:21.580
And that is, I think the boundary that we have to navigate and, uh, figure

54:21.580 --> 54:23.900
it out and tease apart as we go forward.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.620
I think there's so much to do there.

54:25.900 --> 54:30.060
And again, one of the biggest things that has to happen is more dialogue

54:30.060 --> 54:32.940
and more conversations and more collaborations between the two

54:32.940 --> 54:34.580
communities, which is beginning to happen.

54:35.060 --> 54:38.980
So not necessarily just more computation, but also more theory, more dialogue.

54:40.900 --> 54:41.260
Okay.

54:41.300 --> 54:45.580
Um, maybe, you know, moving towards the end of our conversation

54:45.580 --> 54:49.700
there's a couple of questions that I tend to ask to everyone that features

54:49.700 --> 54:53.660
on the show, one of them is about advice to future generations.

54:53.780 --> 54:58.420
So if there is anything that you would have liked to know before starting

54:58.420 --> 55:02.380
your career, was there anything that you would advise, say to current

55:02.380 --> 55:04.060
students or even future students?

55:04.500 --> 55:09.580
Um, I think you need to figure out how you can be extremely good at one

55:09.580 --> 55:11.780
thing and very good at many things.

55:12.300 --> 55:13.540
It's not easy to do.

55:14.060 --> 55:18.340
You have to have a mainstay that where, you know, and that's what, if you think

55:18.340 --> 55:21.780
about, if you're a doctoral student, that's exactly what a PhD is, right?

55:21.780 --> 55:24.780
That you are going to be the expert.

55:25.340 --> 55:30.180
Um, or I mean, not just one of the experts in that particular area and

55:30.180 --> 55:32.580
you're intimately familiar with that, right?

55:32.580 --> 55:33.580
That's what I mean by that.

55:33.580 --> 55:40.340
But I think the, the specialty is becoming, it needs to happen

55:40.420 --> 55:43.060
even along with many other things.

55:43.340 --> 55:48.700
And so the breakdown between what you're doing in your area and it's, it's

55:48.700 --> 55:54.140
interrelation with the other domains is becoming a lot more complex.

55:54.140 --> 55:58.820
And so compared to, I think what it used to be maybe 20, 30 years ago,

55:59.300 --> 56:04.380
the, the awareness and the understanding of how to converse with other

56:04.740 --> 56:10.780
transdisciplinary partners becoming more and more important, um, you know,

56:10.900 --> 56:12.980
controls is changing a lot.

56:13.100 --> 56:18.500
It's no longer a feedback control of a single device or a single system.

56:18.780 --> 56:22.700
It's no longer control of a large scale system is no longer control of

56:22.700 --> 56:24.420
a large scale engineer systems.

56:24.420 --> 56:30.780
It's really things that control is present and needed in a societal scale.

56:31.140 --> 56:35.340
So, which means that you really start to, you need to start thinking about

56:35.780 --> 56:39.940
what does it mean, this concept and this very broad canvas.

56:40.020 --> 56:44.980
How do you apply that in the context of say, for instance, energy justice,

56:44.980 --> 56:49.580
which is a totally different domain, but still there is a notion of here

56:49.580 --> 56:53.620
is a system, here's a performance, here's ways you monitor it and develop

56:53.620 --> 56:56.500
metrics, and here's how you mitigate something, right?

56:56.780 --> 57:01.780
So in order to do all of those things, it seems to me that in addition to being

57:01.780 --> 57:06.340
very good, excellent at one thing, you really need to do at least one thing

57:06.380 --> 57:09.660
where you're completely out of your comfort zone.

57:10.460 --> 57:15.060
And, you know, I think you should do that activity where you're so scared.

57:15.100 --> 57:18.820
Like you, I know nothing about it, but I think it's very important to immerse

57:18.900 --> 57:21.820
ourselves in that endeavor and you learn that thing.

57:22.180 --> 57:27.140
And so that I think gives you the ability to, to really understand

57:27.140 --> 57:30.700
controls and in its essence and in a very broad way.

57:30.900 --> 57:33.580
I mean, for instance, I know you didn't quite ask this question,

57:33.580 --> 57:35.220
but let me answer that anyway.

57:35.700 --> 57:39.220
In our lab, there are sort of two thrusts in my, you know, the active

57:39.220 --> 57:40.700
adaptive control lab at MIT.

57:40.740 --> 57:45.620
One is to do develop control in a very deep sense and look at adaptive

57:45.620 --> 57:48.220
control, you know, and its intersections with machine learning.

57:48.540 --> 57:53.140
The other thrust is in trying to implement control in a very broad

57:53.140 --> 57:58.420
sense and to look at ways in which the whole notion of how you collect

57:58.420 --> 58:03.100
information and implement decisions in a large scale system, say, for instance,

58:03.100 --> 58:08.820
in power grids or in transportation or in other sort of endeavors that you

58:08.820 --> 58:12.180
wouldn't normally think of in terms of what a control is, you know, in a

58:12.180 --> 58:14.580
non-engineered sense in a societal scale system.

58:14.860 --> 58:19.700
So I think having this kind of two pronged attack, I think is very useful.

58:20.420 --> 58:21.700
That's fantastic.

58:21.700 --> 58:26.620
Actually, apologies for not touching on the huge endeavor also that you're

58:26.620 --> 58:28.700
having in the field of smart grids.

58:28.740 --> 58:31.340
That's another major line of research of yours.

58:31.340 --> 58:35.300
And actually I'll put a link to a couple of papers in the description, just for

58:35.300 --> 58:38.380
people who are interested in this topic and in ANUS research.

58:39.620 --> 58:44.900
Just to finish on the topic of future generations, I'm curious whether do you

58:44.900 --> 58:49.780
have some kind of secret sauce for when you feel stuck or, I mean, it's something

58:49.780 --> 58:54.060
that happens a lot for PhD students and in general to any researcher, I would say.

58:54.500 --> 58:57.700
So what is your approach to that feeling?

58:58.180 --> 59:05.620
Yeah, no, I mean, research is all about figuring out how to even realize that

59:05.620 --> 59:09.100
you're stuck and, you know, to get unstuck.

59:10.460 --> 59:16.260
One of the things I learned from my advisor, Professor Narendra, is how to have

59:16.260 --> 59:23.860
the intellectual courage to completely scrap what you're doing and start from

59:23.860 --> 59:24.740
with a clean slate.

59:25.140 --> 59:28.340
Don't try to tweak things and say, OK, all right, maybe you should.

59:28.340 --> 59:28.900
No, no, no, no.

59:29.060 --> 59:33.980
Just pull back and have the courage to just completely chuck everything that you

59:33.980 --> 59:38.300
might have been doing either for the past week or a past month or even a past

59:38.300 --> 59:41.260
year and say, start from scratch.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.340
OK, what is it that you're trying to do?

59:43.660 --> 59:50.620
So starting with a fresh slate, blank slate, clean slate, and really regroup.

59:50.620 --> 59:52.980
And OK, what is that problem?

59:52.980 --> 59:57.900
And to zoom out and ask questions at a very high level and again start zooming

59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.180
in helps enormously.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.500
But for to do that, you should have the courage to chuck what you're doing because

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.660
it's like, oh, my God, I've put so much effort into it and I have all this

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.700
information and knowledge.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.340
Yes, you do.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.660
But believe me, it will help you.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.620
But don't be straightjacketed with what you're facing right now.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:22.140
I found and that's something I learned from Professor Narendra and that has served

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.140
me again and again extremely well.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:28.940
Well, you're serving me a fantastic assist for another question that I ask to

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.420
everyone else that features on your show.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.420
And that's who were the most influential figures in your careers?

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.940
If you had to name three, who would they be?

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:42.460
Definitely, I would start with Professor Narendra.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:49.140
I have learned so much from him how to be a researcher, how to figure out how to

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.100
pick problems and how never to really give up.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:59.820
And that enthusiasm and that optimism is something that I learned from him.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:04.060
Other than that, I don't know if there is, I would say it's directly because of

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.740
interaction with any specific individual.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:12.180
But, you know, all of Kalman's work have been, you know, enormously

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.420
inspirational and sort of mind boggling.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.300
Where did this come?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.980
I mean, like I was talking about Kalman Yakovlevich's lemma, right?

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.180
Where did that come from?

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.220
How did they even think to sort of connect some very two disparate things

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:28.100
from input-output property to a Lyapunov function?

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.300
I have learned a lot from that.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:36.540
And the other, again, works of that, and I began to know about Pravin Varaya

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.780
only and started interacting with them much, much later.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:46.100
But again, his papers, too, I found have been enormously educational and

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:51.700
inspirational in terms of how you can, and there is something that is

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:56.060
attributed to him in terms of what they call is a folk theorem about

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.860
optimization in power grids.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.540
And I find that to be a seminal work that sort of brings in elements of

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:09.300
analysis into something that really was groundbreaking in the context of

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.660
constraint optimization in power grids.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.900
So I would mention, I guess, those three individuals.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.180
Yeah.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.100
Thanks for this.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:21.260
In closing, maybe the last question I want to ask you is out of curiosity,

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.620
on a more personal level.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:28.900
Do you have any like favorite pastime or, and I don't know, do you like reading?

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.460
Do you like any specific type of exercise or anything like that?

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.220
Oh yeah, no, I like to read a lot.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:38.740
I'm more partial to fiction than nonfiction.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.820
So I always have at least one book on iPad to read and one physical book to read.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.140
So, you know, about anything and everything, I mean, I'm part of three

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:52.660
different book clubs and, and, you have any three books to recommend to the

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.900
audience, like your favorite books ever?

01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:00.380
Um, well, uh, the book Thief, um, uh, Cutting for a Stone, those are older.

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.420
And the one, the most recent one I read was Cloud Cuckoo Land, which is

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:10.540
absolutely fantastic, all actually very incisive portrayals of humanity

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.900
and interrelationships.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:12.420
Yeah.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.780
Well, Anu, it's been a pleasure to have you on the show.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.940
It's been really a fantastic ride.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.700
Um, thank you for being here and thanks for taking the time to join us.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.140
It's been my pleasure.

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.020
Absolute pleasure.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.100
Thank you for having me here.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.420
Thank you for listening.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.060
