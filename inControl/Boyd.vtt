Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

00:10.440 --> 00:23.240
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.920
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.200
Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Center of Competency Research on Dependable Ubiquitous

00:31.200 --> 00:35.620
Automation and the International Federation of Automatic Control.

00:35.620 --> 00:40.140
Our guest today is Stephen Boyd, Samsung Professor in the School of Engineering, Department of

00:40.140 --> 00:43.260
Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.840
Welcome to the show, Stephen.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
Thanks Alberto.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.840
I'm very happy to be here.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.060
Well, Stephen, there's a million different ways that I could start this episode.

00:51.060 --> 00:54.920
You are one of the most well-known researchers in our field.

00:54.920 --> 01:01.000
You're ranked among the top 10 researchers in research.com in the engineering and technology

01:01.000 --> 01:02.840
scientists ranking.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.400
And according to Wikipedia, you are well-known for convex optimization.

01:07.400 --> 01:12.080
But I wonder whether you still identify as a control theorist.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
That's a good question.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.200
Actually, I do.

01:15.200 --> 01:20.380
Control was maybe not quite my first field, but it's essentially the field that I grew

01:20.380 --> 01:22.400
up in intellectually.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.720
So I absolutely identify as someone in control.

01:25.720 --> 01:31.200
I do sometimes cringe at the theorist part of it, brings back bad memories and things

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
like that.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.440
But control, absolutely, I do identify as a control person.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.440
Yeah.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.920
Because your first degree was in mathematics.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
That's right.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
From Harvard University.

01:39.920 --> 01:40.920
Is that right?

01:40.920 --> 01:41.920
That's right.

01:41.920 --> 01:42.920
My undergraduate degree was in pure math.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.000
And I even went off to Berkeley for a PhD.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.400
I entered in pure math, but within a year I had transferred to EECS.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
So I'm curious.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.360
What had drawn you to control?

01:53.360 --> 01:56.640
You know, actually, I'd like to say that I thought about these things very carefully

01:56.640 --> 02:01.040
and looked at different fields and, you know, made a table of the pluses and minuses.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.840
And that's a complete lie.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.000
I did no such thing.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.400
It was just completely accidental.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.920
I had been in pure math, but I was getting an inkling that I wanted to do something more

02:10.920 --> 02:12.360
applied.

02:12.360 --> 02:17.560
And I went over to take some classes in EECS at Berkeley.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.280
I took classes from people like, you know, Eugene Wong, Pravin Varaya, Charlie DeSore.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.720
Now I thought this was just a random sampling of classes.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.120
Of course, it wasn't.

02:26.120 --> 02:31.160
These are some of the most mathematical and brilliant people in, you know, the whole area.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.400
And I thought like, wow, this is awesome.

02:33.400 --> 02:38.280
So I transferred to EECS in my second year of my PhD program.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
Yeah.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.200
And I think I was also reading on perhaps the Control Systems magazine, you were touring.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
That's true.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.920
And you were involved in a rock and roll band.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.160
I'm not sure how does that blend with, you know.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.160
Not a band.

02:53.160 --> 02:58.400
So actually this, it does kind of explain, you know, my background, which is very weird,

02:58.400 --> 02:59.400
I think.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
Yeah.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.160
Is that related to your passion to EECS?

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
It is.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.200
You know, when I was like, let's say in high school, I did two things.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
Pure math.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.200
So I was into pure math very, very young.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.440
I did pure math.

03:11.440 --> 03:16.240
But I also did a very super applied electrical engineering, right?

03:16.240 --> 03:20.480
So I worked as a stagehand at a large theater in Berkeley, and they had rock and roll shows

03:20.480 --> 03:23.040
come in every weekend or something like that.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.800
And maybe one result of that was, you know, by the time I graduated from high school,

03:26.800 --> 03:30.160
I actually, I knew quite well how rock and roll shows work.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.680
I knew exactly what everything did.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.160
I knew, I even started recognizing people who were touring with, you know, different

03:35.160 --> 03:36.560
bands and things like that.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.520
So anyway, I went off to Harvard as an undergrad.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.280
I was in pure math.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.320
By the way, at this point in my life, I was actually fairly clueless.

03:45.320 --> 03:50.120
I didn't really know that, for example, EE and math were related.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.120
Right.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.840
I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous these days, but I don't know.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.720
Well, I was just pretty clueless also, but it was also just a lot less information out

03:58.720 --> 03:59.720
there.

03:59.720 --> 04:05.040
But I guess in a way you were already familiar with the concept of amplifiers, feedback and

04:05.040 --> 04:06.040
all those things.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.040
Yeah, I certainly did.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.720
When I, you know, when I did electrical engineering, we certainly used math, but it wasn't sort

04:10.720 --> 04:13.400
of like, you know, advanced or fancy kind of math.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
Yeah.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.880
Anyway, so when I went off to Harvard, I remember I wrote a letter, which of course is like

04:18.880 --> 04:23.920
completely hilarious these days, but I wrote a letter to the head of what was then the

04:23.920 --> 04:28.720
second largest rock and roll sound company in the U.S. called Maryland Sound Industries,

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
MSI.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.640
I mean, I'm sure everybody wants to do this, but it's probably so shocked to get a letter

04:33.640 --> 04:36.400
from a kid at Harvard that he responded.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.760
So I went out on a test thing, you know, test drive or whatever.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.680
I went for like maybe two, three days with not a lot of sleep.

04:43.680 --> 04:48.840
I had the great advantage that I knew their systems perfectly because they'd come, you

04:48.840 --> 04:52.960
know, they had something like 14 tours every summer, two or three of them would come through

04:52.960 --> 04:55.360
the theater where I worked and I actually knew their equipment.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
I knew how it worked.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.680
It was actually quite innovative and cool to have like really kind of cool patch panels

04:59.680 --> 05:00.800
and things.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.000
So I knew how it worked.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.740
So I remember they told me, they said, go wire up the left side of the stage, but don't

05:05.740 --> 05:10.700
even think about powering it up, you know, because if I wired it up wrong, everything

05:10.700 --> 05:12.700
would blow up or something like that.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.260
So I went over, I knew how the system where I fixed it all, I wired it all up, came back

05:16.260 --> 05:18.220
and they said, what are you, an idiot?

05:18.220 --> 05:19.220
What happened?

05:19.220 --> 05:20.220
We said to go wire.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.220
I said, it's done.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.420
And they said, well, that's impossible.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.740
No one could do it that fast.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.580
And the guy comes over and looks at it and he starts like holding his head and he says

05:27.580 --> 05:29.820
like, oh my God, he did.

05:29.820 --> 05:35.580
So then what happened was then rumors started spreading of me being a rock and roll sound

05:35.580 --> 05:37.340
wunderkind.

05:37.340 --> 05:38.340
That's what happened.

05:38.340 --> 05:40.020
And actually, and they got better and better.

05:40.020 --> 05:42.780
I mean, you know, someone said, yeah, he set up the entire stage.

05:42.780 --> 05:46.420
He did an entire set change in between acts in like 90 seconds flat.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.860
You know, it just, all sorts of crazy stories grew.

05:48.860 --> 05:52.100
Anyway, the result was that I was hired by that company.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.900
And I told them, look, it's, this is all wrong.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.440
I've seen your equipment.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.540
That's how I know how to put it together.

05:58.540 --> 06:02.940
And they were like, anyway, the stories kept growing, actually for years they kept growing.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.260
I worked for that company maybe for about six years on and off.

06:06.260 --> 06:11.100
So basically I was either in school or I was essentially on the road doing rock and roll

06:11.100 --> 06:12.100
sound.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.420
So I guess there was your first sliding door.

06:15.420 --> 06:19.420
You could have actually made a career in that direction, but you decided to go to Berkeley

06:19.420 --> 06:21.700
for a PhD in control theory.

06:21.700 --> 06:22.700
Exactly.

06:22.700 --> 06:26.980
I remember very well when the owner of the sound company was like telling me like, dude,

06:26.980 --> 06:30.940
I don't know about this PhD thing, but you should do this right now.

06:30.940 --> 06:35.380
Actually, I thought, I mean, I thought about it, not too much actually, to tell you the

06:35.380 --> 06:36.380
truth.

06:36.380 --> 06:40.340
What was funny was I met him about 10 years ago.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.540
So long, long time, many decades after I had stopped working for them.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.580
And two things happened when we chatted.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.580
It was funny.

06:48.580 --> 06:53.660
Number one is I was thinking to myself, the stories I remember from that time, maybe I've

06:53.660 --> 06:54.660
improved.

06:54.660 --> 06:55.660
I probably, I did improve them.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.300
I don't know if they're true or not.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.980
I mean, they were probably based in truth, but anyway.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.260
He confirmed that some of the stories that I was most suspicious of, these are my own

07:03.260 --> 07:04.260
stories.

07:04.260 --> 07:05.860
He confirmed they were true.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.300
And then reminded me of even crazier stories that I had completely forgotten.

07:09.300 --> 07:17.180
So anyway, so, so anyway, but somehow the appeal of Volterra series was more, you know,

07:17.180 --> 07:20.060
when you put it that way, I think the answer is no.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.060
I can tell you this.

07:21.060 --> 07:26.740
If you're, if you're mixing house in a 15,000 seat venue, right.

07:26.740 --> 07:31.940
And you know, on your headphones, the stage manager says, we're T minus four seconds.

07:31.940 --> 07:37.300
And you pop your button across the, to unmute all the sub masters on the mixing console.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.820
You know, this, this beats Volterra series.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.820
I'm just going to say it.

07:41.820 --> 07:42.820
I'm sorry.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.820
It's good.

07:43.820 --> 07:44.820
No.

07:44.820 --> 07:49.580
And anyway, I guess when you were in Berkeley, you were surrounded by people that nowadays

07:49.580 --> 07:51.420
are considered giants in the field.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.540
I'm thinking of Chua, Dessour, Sastry, just to name a few.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.900
And I was wondering, what was your experience there?

07:58.900 --> 08:00.540
Oh, it was great.

08:00.540 --> 08:05.580
I mean, they are the reason I switched over to EECS.

08:05.580 --> 08:12.300
I mean, you know, they were, and in very different ways, you know, Dessour was precise and very

08:12.300 --> 08:15.020
clear in a beautiful way.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.500
Chua just knew so much.

08:17.500 --> 08:21.580
It was just, you know, had an interest just all over the map and all sorts of weird areas

08:21.580 --> 08:26.180
involving, you know, nonlinear circuits, but also all sorts of crazy stuff.

08:26.180 --> 08:29.980
And then Sastry, Shankar Sastry was amazing.

08:29.980 --> 08:34.700
He was this kind of young, I think I called him a child professor because he really was.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.460
I mean, he was just a kid.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.100
Had just an infinite amount of energy.

08:40.100 --> 08:44.900
These three were just, you know, if you take the convex hull of these three, it's very

08:44.900 --> 08:45.900
impressive.

08:45.900 --> 08:46.900
Let's put it that way.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.900
So, yeah, they had a big influence on me.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.820
And your investigations there were, as you mentioned, fairly theoretical.

08:53.820 --> 08:58.420
I mean, yeah, you know, in doing my homework for this podcast, I was checking your first

08:58.420 --> 09:04.980
paper with Leon Chua, I believe, on the passivity criterion for TIN ports.

09:04.980 --> 09:10.620
And I actually love the abstract, it was incredible, because it already gives a bit of a hint about

09:10.620 --> 09:14.340
your future style in a way, which is quite predictive.

09:14.340 --> 09:18.700
You say there are existing proofs of the passivity criterion for linear time invariant

09:18.700 --> 09:25.460
distributed ports are either incorrect or too involved, requiring the use of advanced

09:25.460 --> 09:27.460
mathematics such as distribution theory.

09:27.460 --> 09:31.940
This paper presents a simple but completely rigorous proof using only basic, real and

09:31.940 --> 09:32.980
complex analysis.

09:32.980 --> 09:35.260
I think that's wonderful already.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.260
That's great.

09:36.260 --> 09:40.900
Now, in my defense, I will say that that was at the very beginning of my transition from

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
math to ECS.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.900
I guess a lot of people think about, you know, how is, what are the good parts about math

09:45.900 --> 09:49.620
and why should you learn some and stuff like that.

09:49.620 --> 09:53.140
One aesthetic in math is simplicity.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.140
I mean, you know-

09:54.140 --> 09:55.140
Occam's razor.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.140
Yeah.

09:56.140 --> 09:57.140
Some people make stuff really complicated.

09:57.140 --> 10:01.780
And, you know, there's stories, possibly even true of, you know, Russian mathematicians

10:01.780 --> 10:05.340
who spend seven years working on a paper and someone says, why?

10:05.340 --> 10:08.380
And he said, the proof used to be seven pages.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.780
Now it's three quarters of a page.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.420
Now I'm happy with it, right?

10:11.940 --> 10:18.300
And so, you know, so there is this very clean and lean aesthetic in math.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.100
And I think it's, it's actually guided me.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.100
I'm very attracted to it.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.100
I won't say I'm not.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.100
Right.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.100
It's, I think it's very cool.

10:25.100 --> 10:28.460
You think that's the use of theory in practice or is there-

10:28.460 --> 10:30.660
Oh, I think that's precisely the theory, right?

10:30.660 --> 10:31.900
I think that's exactly the idea.

10:31.900 --> 10:37.460
I think that, you know, I see a lot of people who imagine that theory is used in practice

10:37.460 --> 10:38.460
like this, right?

10:38.500 --> 10:43.220
Like I go grab a theorem from a journal and then I apply it or whatever, whatever that

10:43.220 --> 10:44.220
means.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.220
I don't even know what that means.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.780
But the point is that's completely wrong, right?

10:46.780 --> 10:51.420
I'm not aware of any theorem that's actually used in anything.

10:51.420 --> 10:54.740
I mean, maybe in some kind of, you know, number theory or something, but it doesn't matter

10:54.740 --> 10:56.020
for cryptography.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.540
But other than that, I'm not aware of any.

10:58.540 --> 11:05.740
So in my opinion, the real value of math in applied settings, control being one of them,

11:05.780 --> 11:10.020
or at least one of them, is what it gives you is clarity of thought.

11:10.020 --> 11:13.560
And that's extremely important in practice.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.740
So let me explain that, right?

11:14.740 --> 11:19.220
If I, you know, here we are in Silicon Valley and people build stuff and, you know, I could

11:19.220 --> 11:21.940
get one team and say, you know, go build this thing.

11:21.940 --> 11:25.700
And with a lot of high level tools now, you can bang something together that looks like

11:25.700 --> 11:26.700
it's working.

11:26.700 --> 11:32.380
I mean, there's kind of a UI and the app works and something happens, but there's another

11:32.380 --> 11:34.180
style and I've seen other people do this.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.180
It's just beautiful.

11:35.620 --> 11:38.700
And there are people who think about it very deeply, often trained in things like math

11:38.700 --> 11:43.200
or something abstract, and they don't do anything for a day or two, right?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.260
After a day or two, they look up and they go, hey, you know what?

11:46.260 --> 11:52.660
The 87 things that we've been asked to implement are actually all instances of only three different

11:52.660 --> 11:53.660
things.

11:53.660 --> 11:56.860
So we're going to implement that correctly.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.840
And then, you know, blah, blah, blah, it'll all fit together.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.620
So what happens is they'll build something.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.700
And here's where this is practically useful.

12:03.700 --> 12:08.460
You know, when people just hack something together to knock off 87 requirements, it's

12:08.460 --> 12:14.560
going to be horrible code, badly structured, there's going to be all sorts of weird dependencies.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.560
It won't be correct.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.700
You'll never be able to actually debug it.

12:17.700 --> 12:22.260
You definitely cannot extend it or anything like that or modify it.

12:22.260 --> 12:25.660
Whereas when you see people who actually kind of think abstractly and actually took the

12:25.660 --> 12:32.660
time to work out what were the correct abstractions, you get beautiful, lean code that has very

12:32.660 --> 12:34.180
high probability being correct.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.180
It's extensible.

12:35.180 --> 12:39.420
And then just as a purely practical matter, the cost of ownership of that project is a

12:39.420 --> 12:40.420
lot less.

12:40.420 --> 12:44.180
Because, you know, it actually will, number one, it will work.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.620
Number two, it's extensible.

12:45.620 --> 12:46.700
It's maintainable.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.420
It's like Linux, for example.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.220
That's a good model of this.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.740
Well, here, there's a lot to unpack already.

12:52.740 --> 12:57.420
I think implicitly, you're touching also on the concept of maybe something that we're

12:57.420 --> 13:03.580
going to talk about, the concept of disciplined convex programming, but also generally the

13:03.580 --> 13:08.820
idea that maybe this is actually the value of human creativity in a way that of parsing

13:08.820 --> 13:14.140
through different concepts and being able to synthesize in a way what is important and

13:14.140 --> 13:20.740
how to categorize different ideas or I guess classes in the language of computer science.

13:20.740 --> 13:21.740
I'm not sure.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.300
But yeah, maybe taking a step back.

13:24.300 --> 13:28.900
I feel like we're diverging from your PhD at Berkeley.

13:28.900 --> 13:35.780
I just wanted to understand how that actually relates to you today in a way.

13:35.780 --> 13:40.860
So how do we connect a person that, you know, had this crazy interest for mathematics, full

13:40.860 --> 13:47.260
time operators, very, very theoretical concepts with the person that you are today?

13:47.260 --> 13:54.060
So something that I would associate you to very applied concepts, very useful in a way

13:54.060 --> 13:57.220
concepts for everyday engineering.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.060
Yeah, it does apply.

13:59.060 --> 14:04.260
As I said, that was sort of the beginning of my transition from pure math to EECS in

14:04.260 --> 14:06.420
general to more practical things.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.260
You can call it applied math.

14:08.260 --> 14:10.380
Control was one interest.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.020
So I think that was the very beginnings of it.

14:12.220 --> 14:16.300
Actually, it's since then, I mean, I'm still on that journey.

14:16.300 --> 14:24.260
And it's super interesting to me to see how people in different fields use math.

14:24.260 --> 14:28.140
And you know, by this time in my life, I've visited many, many fields.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.780
So I've been a sort of a visitor at many.

14:30.780 --> 14:34.700
But I've actually spent time, you know, spent like, you know, whatever, you know, a couple

14:34.700 --> 14:37.100
of year periods in a bunch of fields.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.900
I mean, circuit design was one, that was very weird.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.740
Finance is another.

14:42.460 --> 14:45.700
And what's interesting to me are the anthropological issues.

14:45.700 --> 14:49.980
How do people use math in practical settings?

14:49.980 --> 14:53.380
So it's really questions like, you know, how do they think about this?

14:53.380 --> 14:56.860
Do they use a lot of brute force computing?

14:56.860 --> 14:57.900
It's so interesting.

14:57.900 --> 15:01.580
And what's very interesting to me is I found out that in these different fields, which

15:01.580 --> 15:04.700
are, you know, speak completely different dialects.

15:04.700 --> 15:11.180
I mean, they're not completely mutually unintelligible, I can guarantee it.

15:11.180 --> 15:16.460
What's interesting when you look at that is the same topics come up over and over again.

15:16.460 --> 15:20.940
You know, one would be, you know, how good is your model?

15:20.940 --> 15:24.660
And the acknowledgement that your model is not perfect, right?

15:24.660 --> 15:29.780
You know, in let's say circuit design, you know, spice model for a process that's already

15:29.780 --> 15:33.380
pretty mature, that's actually pretty good.

15:33.380 --> 15:38.580
In finance, you know, the models are, or as a friend of mine says, he's super happy if

15:38.580 --> 15:40.420
he gets the sign right, right?

15:40.420 --> 15:45.820
So, you know, this is not Newtonian mechanics, right?

15:45.820 --> 15:48.060
But then, you know, robustness is another one.

15:48.060 --> 15:54.700
Like, you know, how do you design something or decide on good actions or build a good

15:54.700 --> 15:59.620
model that's going to be robust to things being not what you thought they were?

15:59.620 --> 16:02.020
And that comes up in every single field.

16:02.020 --> 16:06.540
They all have interesting different ways to talk about it and think about it.

16:06.540 --> 16:11.900
And some of the methods that are used are from one field or other might look very unsophisticated,

16:11.900 --> 16:13.620
but in fact work very well.

16:13.620 --> 16:18.540
So that's sort of very interesting to me to see how people do this.

16:18.540 --> 16:24.800
I guess that's really the value in a way of traveling, at least from an intellectual perspective.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.620
There is this quote from Mark Twain.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.540
He says, travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow mindedness.

16:31.540 --> 16:34.860
And it seems like this very well resonates with what you just said.

16:34.860 --> 16:35.860
Yeah.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.740
So, you know, whether traveling intellectually taught you something that you didn't know before.

16:40.740 --> 16:41.740
Absolutely.

16:41.740 --> 16:44.580
I strongly recommend it to everyone.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.060
Just to know a little bit about different fields.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.260
One of the interesting things is that you really get people speaking different dialects

16:50.260 --> 16:51.740
and you can't.

16:51.740 --> 16:57.920
They are mutually unintelligible unless someone is there who actually speaks both dialects.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.380
It's very hard to translate from one to the other.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.940
And now I know when I go into a field and I listen and I'm like, these people sound

17:04.020 --> 17:05.820
like idiots to me.

17:05.820 --> 17:12.060
But now I know from experience that I should just calm down, you know, wait a couple of months.

17:12.060 --> 17:16.060
Maybe some of these terms are going to start and then I'll start understanding what they're saying.

17:16.060 --> 17:17.380
And in fact, they're not idiots.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.740
And this has happened to me many, many times.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.460
And it's so it's actually quite interesting.

17:22.460 --> 17:26.100
I think it's very good for all of academia and for research.

17:26.100 --> 17:30.300
It's super good to travel, to look at other areas.

17:30.300 --> 17:36.420
I guess your first travel was from control itself towards the world, I guess, of computation.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.820
Would it be fair to say?

17:37.820 --> 17:38.820
Yeah.

17:38.820 --> 17:43.500
Actually, I think the very first academic stuff I did was on modeling of nonlinear systems

17:43.500 --> 17:45.820
via Volterra series.

17:45.820 --> 17:49.420
I also dabbled in, at that time, adaptive control.

17:49.420 --> 17:54.620
And then actually became interested in designing control systems using numerical optimization

17:54.620 --> 17:55.620
methods.

17:55.620 --> 17:56.620
Right.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.620
So that's one thing I did.

17:57.940 --> 18:03.100
I think that's the branch that grew into what I ended up really focusing on.

18:03.100 --> 18:07.420
And, you know, what I liked about that stuff, I mean, that was a long time ago, what was

18:07.420 --> 18:14.540
very interesting about it was that it appealed to me aesthetically because it was both theoretical,

18:14.540 --> 18:19.380
it was using all sorts of stuff about, you know, the parametrization of stabilizing controllers.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.980
It was using kind of theoretical stuff.

18:21.980 --> 18:26.740
It also used computation to actually solve problems.

18:26.860 --> 18:29.580
And then at the same time, it was actually extremely useful, right?

18:29.580 --> 18:31.700
It actually solved real problems.

18:31.700 --> 18:35.420
So I think that combination of things just really appealed to me.

18:35.420 --> 18:37.500
And I mean, it still does, to be honest.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.980
So I think it's great.

18:38.980 --> 18:39.980
Yeah.

18:39.980 --> 18:45.420
In fact, I mean, what I saw, you know, doing a bit of searching was that you got your PhD

18:45.420 --> 18:47.260
in 1985.

18:47.260 --> 18:53.060
And from 1988, what I observed is that the word computation starts to appear in your

18:53.060 --> 18:57.980
publications and it grows from 1988 to 1992.

18:57.980 --> 19:03.340
It goes like one, one, and then three, four per year.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.420
So it definitely seems to resonate with you.

19:05.420 --> 19:08.940
And at the same time, also the keyword optimization as well.

19:08.940 --> 19:14.740
So you were moving definitely in that direction from the world of nonlinear systems and very

19:14.740 --> 19:17.060
complicated mathematical tools, I would say.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.060
Yeah.

19:18.060 --> 19:23.180
And I very much like the idea that sort of, you know, some advanced mathematical things

19:23.180 --> 19:28.980
like convex optimization, actually they are very mathematical, but they're also unbelievably

19:28.980 --> 19:32.460
useful, which is super interesting because, you know, you normally think of this weird

19:32.460 --> 19:37.700
axis where, you know, on one side, there's like pure theory and it's pretty useless,

19:37.700 --> 19:38.700
right?

19:38.700 --> 19:41.980
And then on the other side, you have something that's, you know, there's almost no theory

19:41.980 --> 19:42.980
and it's super useful.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.380
And of course, you do see some of that.

19:45.380 --> 19:49.380
But what's interesting is that there are a lot of things that are both and I find that

19:49.380 --> 19:51.540
sort of very interesting.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.700
I think it's very cool.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.860
I definitely wanted to talk about this topic.

19:56.860 --> 20:02.100
Both of your most well-known publications or books rather, Linear Metrics Inequalities

20:02.100 --> 20:09.220
in Systems and Control Theory and Convex Optimization are masterpieces in this domain.

20:09.220 --> 20:15.240
And they both involve quite a bit of convex optimization and they do turn into something

20:16.100 --> 20:19.840
that is incredibly useful and that's perhaps also reflected in the success, at least in

20:19.840 --> 20:23.160
terms of citations, if we take that as a measure.

20:23.160 --> 20:27.220
And I'm wondering, I mean, one question I would have for you is why should everybody

20:27.220 --> 20:30.320
know a bit of convex optimization?

20:30.320 --> 20:31.320
That's a good question.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.320
Yeah.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.160
Of course, it does depend on our definition of everybody because if you really mean just

20:35.160 --> 20:40.680
everybody, then I'm not sure I'd be on board with that statement.

20:40.680 --> 20:47.040
So if you mean anyone who does any kind of quantitative work, then I would totally agree

20:47.040 --> 20:48.600
with the statement.

20:48.600 --> 20:53.640
And yeah, I can say a little bit about why I think it is important for anyone who...

20:53.640 --> 20:55.760
And that's many, many fields, right?

20:55.760 --> 21:00.600
And there's the obvious ones like whatever, all of engineering, right?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.680
Much of social science these days.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.160
So maybe quite a lot of science.

21:05.160 --> 21:12.400
So the reason is it's an incredibly important tool to actually solve optimization problems,

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
right?

21:13.400 --> 21:18.520
That the usual sort of story on optimization problems is here's what I'd like to solve.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.280
And then basically, I mean, people don't admit it when they're teaching these classes, but

21:22.280 --> 21:25.560
the bottom line is we can't actually solve most of those problems, right?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.120
You just can't, right?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.520
I mean, maybe that doesn't matter.

21:29.520 --> 21:35.000
We have heuristics that do well and if you get a good model or if you make good

21:35.000 --> 21:38.640
predictions or if your hedge fund makes money, you're fine.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.000
You don't need to worry about that.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.240
But the fact is there is a group of mathematical optimization problems that we can solve numerically

21:47.240 --> 21:50.600
via computers really, really well.

21:50.600 --> 21:55.720
I mean, I used to go around and say things like, oh, the great advantage is you get the

21:55.720 --> 21:56.920
global optimum.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.240
There's no apologies.

21:58.240 --> 22:02.600
You don't have a little star and a footnote and the footnote when you say, oh, I minimize

22:02.600 --> 22:07.760
this and the footnote says, well, maybe or maybe I didn't or something like that, right?

22:07.760 --> 22:12.280
So I used to do that until actually I remember I met someone who was a senior executive at

22:12.280 --> 22:14.800
a large semiconductor firm.

22:14.800 --> 22:22.840
So I was chatting with him and I said, look, this is the best design of this thing that

22:22.840 --> 22:23.840
there is.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.480
And he looked at me and said, how could you possibly know that?

22:26.480 --> 22:27.480
How could you know?

22:27.480 --> 22:30.040
And I realized like for a normal person, that's the correct response.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.920
Like what hubris, right?

22:31.960 --> 22:35.120
What would cause a person to say this is the best there is, right?

22:35.120 --> 22:40.240
And I said, I started my usual spiel, which was like, hey, look, you know, basically,

22:40.240 --> 22:44.040
you know, it has to do with the mathematical properties of the functions involved and I'm

22:44.040 --> 22:45.160
blabbering on and on.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.640
And he just puts his hand up and says, stop, stop right there.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
And I was like, what is it?

22:49.640 --> 22:55.200
And he said, look, fine, he said, but that's only the best design for this particular circuit

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
configuration.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.400
And I was like, yeah, you're right.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.880
And he said, but there's lots of others.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.240
How do you know there's not another one?

23:00.240 --> 23:02.080
And I said, you're right.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.880
And then he said, now you be quiet and I'm going to tell you what's useful about convex

23:06.880 --> 23:07.880
optimization.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.440
So here I am being lectured by a senior circuit designer.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.920
By the way, so, and he says to me, look, I don't care about your global stuff.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
Who cares?

23:16.920 --> 23:18.920
If you do real engineering, nothing is global.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.280
And I didn't even know what that means.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.280
And I said, okay, granted.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.120
And then he says, look, here's what's useful.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.480
When you solve these things, you don't need a starting point, number one.

23:27.480 --> 23:32.040
Number two, you don't need to babysit the algorithm.

23:32.040 --> 23:37.720
And he said, we've looked at a lot of these algorithms that do circuit design and stuff

23:37.720 --> 23:38.800
like that.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.640
They require a starting point, right?

23:41.640 --> 23:46.520
He said, then they take off and they'll go from a good design to a quite good design.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.600
And he said, do you know what we call a good design around here?

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
I'm like, no, what?

23:49.600 --> 23:52.000
And he said, done, done.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.840
He said, we are under unbelievable business pressure to get things out there.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.280
And I said, well, since you have a good design, like we don't want to get another 15% of performance

24:00.280 --> 24:01.280
out of it.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.280
We want to tape it out.

24:02.280 --> 24:06.280
So I listened and I realized like, oh my God, like he's totally right.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.880
And what's interesting is how it, where it goes in control.

24:09.880 --> 24:17.200
So in control, you know, if you embed a convex optimization solver in a control system, as

24:17.200 --> 24:21.960
you might do an MPC or for actuator allocation, it's not a question.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.520
It's not like the fact that you're getting global optimal, who cares?

24:25.520 --> 24:32.560
What matters is these algorithms can be made so reliable that they can be embedded in systems

24:32.560 --> 24:36.960
with absolutely no oversight that solve things a thousand times a second in safety, critical

24:36.960 --> 24:37.960
things.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.400
And they just don't fail.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.640
That's actually the real value I would say, right?

24:42.640 --> 24:43.640
Of this.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.560
So, so anyway, I think there are a lot of practical values.

24:45.560 --> 24:49.200
They're not the obvious ones that maybe I thought when I was young, let's put it that

24:49.200 --> 24:50.200
way.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.200
Yeah.

24:51.200 --> 24:55.280
And I find very interesting the fact that you really interfaced with the industrial

24:55.280 --> 24:57.440
world and really hardcore levels.

24:57.440 --> 25:02.240
I was reading that your CVX gen, which I'm sure we're going to talk about later, has

25:02.240 --> 25:05.640
been used in SpaceX missions recently.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.840
And I was wondering what was your experience there?

25:07.840 --> 25:11.520
Like thinking about the cultural difference, if you want, between the world of academia

25:11.520 --> 25:16.760
in which you presumably live, but also the other world, the real world in a sense.

25:16.760 --> 25:17.760
Yeah.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.760
So that's interesting.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.760
Actually, it wasn't used recently.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.440
Every single one from the prototypes through, it's just in production now.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.440
Yeah.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.320
So, and to be completely clear about that, how much I had to do with it was very, very

25:28.320 --> 25:29.320
little.

25:29.320 --> 25:35.360
It was my student, Thomas Lipp and Lars Blackmore, who were the ones who really pioneered these

25:35.360 --> 25:36.360
things.

25:36.360 --> 25:43.000
It's wonderful to see these things realized in very sophisticated settings and also to

25:43.000 --> 25:44.520
deliver incredible value.

25:44.520 --> 25:49.000
You know, classical control and things like that just wasn't going to cut it for this,

25:49.680 --> 25:50.680
So that was very gratifying.

25:50.680 --> 25:55.880
I mean, there's been a lot of others, you know, in areas like finance and control and

25:55.880 --> 25:59.960
energy management that it's very nice just to see people using this stuff.

25:59.960 --> 26:06.000
I mean, I remember once I went to Tesla and some people who ran their grid scale storage

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
products.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.400
It's very cool, right?

26:08.400 --> 26:11.040
They have a giant cargo container full of batteries.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.280
They have a Raspberry Pi and on it is running CVX Pi.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.280
Wow.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.880
And they told me, actually, it's very funny.

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
They told me their problem.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.640
I listened.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.320
It wasn't quite convex, but there's a street fighting trick, you know?

26:23.320 --> 26:26.720
So I'm sitting there and they finish and I said, well, how do you solve it?

26:26.720 --> 26:29.560
Expecting that I'm going to have to tell them this trick.

26:29.560 --> 26:33.920
They proceed to then tell me precisely the trick and articulate it perfectly.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.320
And I'm like, whoa, how did you guys figure that out?

26:37.320 --> 26:38.320
And then they looked at each other.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.120
They looked at me and they said, we took your class.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.080
So I was like, okay, good, good.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.600
So I was quite proud of that.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.280
And actually it's one of those things where I said, well, so you don't need me.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.280
That's great.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.280
This is awesome.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.280
And thanks for showing me this.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.720
So I was very gratified that it happened.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.600
Maybe talking about convex optimization and your classes and that, I mean, I'm sure also

26:58.600 --> 27:04.400
we're going to talk about teaching later because you're the author of a legendary series on

27:04.400 --> 27:07.880
convex optimization on YouTube and that is free access.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.640
And there's definitely a lot to talk about there as well.

27:10.640 --> 27:15.440
But I was trying to trace back a history of convex optimization somehow.

27:15.440 --> 27:20.560
And of course the concepts of convexity go all the way back to, you know, Euclid, Archimedes

27:20.560 --> 27:22.280
and optimization.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.560
We can trace it back to Fermat, Lagrange and blah, blah, blah.

27:25.560 --> 27:31.800
But I was wondering whether the actual start of convex optimization should be pinpointed

27:31.800 --> 27:35.680
to linear programming, simplex algorithm, Danzig.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.080
And then it seems like a very recent theory.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.080
I think that's right.

27:39.080 --> 27:44.160
The theory of convexity was codified maybe around the turn of the last century, right?

27:44.160 --> 27:48.600
So that's when you would get, you know, but of course it had been used before that.

27:48.600 --> 27:53.240
I mean, we still see fields where people are using essentially convex optimization and

27:53.240 --> 27:55.640
either don't know it or don't point it out, right?

27:55.640 --> 27:59.400
So you look at something, you go, oh, that's just a conjugate of that function, like, or

27:59.400 --> 28:00.400
something like that.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.680
And so the ideas were there, actually the inequalities were there.

28:03.680 --> 28:07.760
It just got a common name, you know, around the turn of the last century.

28:07.800 --> 28:14.520
Now, it was pretty much a theory then because computation was very limited.

28:14.520 --> 28:18.320
But starting, you know, around mid 40s, I would say, is when things get interesting

28:18.320 --> 28:23.400
and that coincides precisely with the development of the digital computer.

28:23.400 --> 28:28.440
And you know, it wasn't long after, I mean, if you think about Danzig coming up with,

28:28.440 --> 28:34.520
you know, a simplex method for linear programming, it was not that long after the development

28:34.520 --> 28:36.760
of the first actual computers, right?

28:36.760 --> 28:42.680
So, and I remember I actually overlapped with him at Stanford when I first came and I remember

28:42.680 --> 28:47.960
him telling me something like that it was a huge big deal to solve like a linear program

28:47.960 --> 28:53.840
with like 30 or 40 variables, which, you know, is laughable now, but he said that it was

28:53.840 --> 28:57.720
a lot of effort and when they did it, they all like, you know, they went out and had

28:57.720 --> 28:58.720
some beer to celebrate.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.520
I mean, it was a big deal.

29:00.520 --> 29:04.400
So it was one of the very first applications of digital computers.

29:04.400 --> 29:10.080
But if I were going to say, you know, when does the, I mean, from a mathematical point

29:10.080 --> 29:13.720
of view, you'd have to say, end of the 19th century, right?

29:13.720 --> 29:17.840
But from the practical point of view, I think you'd have to say around 1950.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.840
1950.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.840
Yeah.

29:19.840 --> 29:24.880
And, and I guess then the developments were the, I mean, the most important ones were

29:24.880 --> 29:29.680
the development of the interior point methods, I guess, ellipsoid method probably.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.680
Yeah.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.680
Well, those are later.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.680
Yeah.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.640
So you actually had two traditions.

29:34.640 --> 29:41.000
It was actually very interesting in the West, in optimization, OR, and these kinds of areas.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.200
The tradition was you'd either work on like linear programming or nonlinear programming,

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
right?

29:48.200 --> 29:49.200
And that was the distinction.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.960
I mean, it makes perfect sense.

29:50.960 --> 29:55.080
I mean, it was fine, you know, and it's like linear programming was easy, interesting,

29:55.080 --> 30:01.160
you know, nonlinear was more expressive, but, you know, it was complicated and maybe you

30:01.160 --> 30:04.600
didn't even get the solution when you apply these algorithms to it.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.760
And I think in the Soviet Union, however, there was a big focus, this is now in the

30:08.760 --> 30:13.240
sixties, on actually convex optimization.

30:13.240 --> 30:18.320
And so there was a lot of work done in the sixties and seventies and eighties in the

30:18.320 --> 30:19.320
Soviet Union.

30:19.320 --> 30:24.200
I think we will talk about that later, where they really focused on convex optimization

30:24.200 --> 30:27.680
and they came up with all sorts of things.

30:27.680 --> 30:31.040
Interior point method was an interesting, super interesting method.

30:31.040 --> 30:36.840
Of course, it's actually in practice, you know, pretty much not used and not useful.

30:36.840 --> 30:41.080
And of course the converse of that is something like the simplex method, which in the sixties

30:41.080 --> 30:45.520
was shown to be worst case exponential, but it didn't stop the hundreds of thousands of

30:45.520 --> 30:51.680
people using it every day because it just worked unbelievably well in practice, right?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.800
Interior point methods was also an interesting thing.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.440
You know, that was a big, you know, rage in the late eighties and the nineties.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.880
And I mean, it was crazy, but actually it turned out when people went back and looked

31:02.880 --> 31:05.160
at the history, there were precursors of this.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.680
I mean, this always happens.

31:06.680 --> 31:12.000
And it turned out there was essentially a very clean interior point method that was

31:12.000 --> 31:14.820
from the sixties by this guy Deakin.

31:14.820 --> 31:18.480
And I remember corresponding with some of my friends who were then in Moscow at the

31:18.480 --> 31:19.480
time.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.880
And they said, they said something great.

31:20.880 --> 31:27.240
They said, Deakin is hardly known in the Soviet Union and unheard of in the West.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.240
Right.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.480
You know, you look at these things like they were pretty good.

31:30.480 --> 31:37.260
They were like competitive with the algorithms that people in the West were writing and writing

31:37.260 --> 31:39.120
papers on.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.880
And they imagined that this was like revolutionary and, you know, nothing like this has ever

31:43.880 --> 31:44.880
been done before.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.120
And the answer was, you're wrong.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.760
It was done in 1967, you know, in the Soviet Union.

31:49.760 --> 31:54.920
The interplay between the Soviet Union and, you know, the Western world, both, you know,

31:54.920 --> 31:59.400
mathematics, but also I would say in control are so interesting.

31:59.400 --> 32:04.520
And I think there's a fantastic summary in your book on linear matrix inequalities about

32:04.520 --> 32:09.480
the key events also in that domain specifically, not just in convex optimization.

32:09.480 --> 32:13.680
And there you're actually right that it is fair to say that Yakubovich is the father

32:13.680 --> 32:18.560
of the field of LMIs and Lyapunov the grandfather of the field.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
Yes.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.280
And the new development at the stage where you write the book is the ability to directly

32:23.280 --> 32:24.760
solve that's right.

32:24.760 --> 32:25.760
General LMIs.

32:25.760 --> 32:32.120
I thought that was a fantastic sentence, but it seems like Willems in his 1971 paper is

32:32.120 --> 32:37.080
the one that actually points out there is a known appreciation that's right for LMIs

32:37.080 --> 32:38.080
in control.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.080
Yeah.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.080
So that also has a very long history.

32:40.080 --> 32:45.240
I mean, it goes to Lyapunov and it goes even into the 19th century and basically comes,

32:45.240 --> 32:52.000
I think if you really traced it back to physics, to the concept of an invariant at first, right?

32:52.000 --> 32:55.920
That's a quantity that doesn't change as the system evolves, right?

32:55.920 --> 33:01.340
So, you know, if you have a closed system, it could be the total mass or the, you know,

33:01.340 --> 33:07.360
or the total energy or the angular momentum about some axis or something, right?

33:07.360 --> 33:12.840
And then it doesn't take much to generalize that to put an inequality there and to say,

33:12.840 --> 33:14.760
how about a dissipated quantity?

33:14.760 --> 33:20.120
That's a quantity that's always decreasing along trajectories of a very complex system.

33:20.120 --> 33:24.760
And the whole point that was recognized even in the 19th century was that there were times

33:24.760 --> 33:30.680
when you could identify something that was either an invariant or a dissipated quantity

33:30.680 --> 33:35.640
without actually being able to solve for the trajectory, right?

33:35.640 --> 33:40.720
So you could have a three, four body gravitational problem and say, at that point, you could

33:40.720 --> 33:45.080
do this, I mean, numerically, which would be horrible because it'd be actual people,

33:45.080 --> 33:51.080
you know, with, I guess, you know, hand calculators or something, but, you know, adding machines.

33:51.080 --> 33:55.080
But what was interesting, it's super interesting, right, that you could actually, it was fully

33:55.080 --> 33:56.520
appreciated then.

33:56.520 --> 34:02.080
And of course, that comes up in control, right, where you'd say, I can't write down what the

34:02.080 --> 34:03.320
trajectory of this is.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.800
He says, but I'm about to prove to you that it's stable.

34:07.280 --> 34:11.040
You know, in control, we don't even think about that because it's a part of control,

34:11.040 --> 34:12.040
that idea.

34:12.040 --> 34:15.480
But if you think about what that sounds like, I mean, if you really try to pretend you're

34:15.480 --> 34:20.280
no longer 22 and a grad student learning this for the first time, you know, somehow the

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
wonder is lost.

34:21.280 --> 34:26.680
Because you really should say, oh, my God, that's amazing, like, you can't tell me what

34:26.680 --> 34:30.000
the solution of this differential equation, you're like, that's right, I have no idea

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
what's going to happen.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.760
But I can guarantee you that the total energy is conserved or that the total energy is dissipated.

34:37.760 --> 34:38.760
It's kind of cool, right?

34:38.760 --> 34:40.380
I think you have to admit.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.380
It's incredible.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.480
And I wonder whether you think this is the most important concept?

34:44.480 --> 34:47.920
I mean, how do you look back at the book on LMIs?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.560
Yeah, I think that that's right.

34:49.560 --> 34:54.760
I mean, that's the essential concept, which, you know, you can trace back to the 19th century,

34:54.760 --> 35:00.760
you know, specifically for linear matrix inequalities, which basically looks at quadratic functions

35:01.520 --> 35:05.000
that are these quantities that either decrease or invariant.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.920
Usually in most interesting applications, they're dissipative, right?

35:07.920 --> 35:08.920
They decrease.

35:08.920 --> 35:13.800
And, you know, in the 40s, people had worked out, like, really cool ways to solve these

35:13.800 --> 35:14.840
inequalities, right?

35:14.840 --> 35:15.840
Very simple ones, right?

35:15.840 --> 35:19.840
And there were graphical methods, you'd literally get out some graph paper and draw some curve.

35:19.840 --> 35:24.920
And, you know, if it stays away from some point in the complex plane, then anyway, that

35:24.920 --> 35:25.920
was one.

35:26.080 --> 35:31.320
There was a connection to control figured out with things like algebraic Riccati equations.

35:31.320 --> 35:35.520
But I think the really interesting thing, and as you say, Willems and others, you know,

35:35.520 --> 35:40.960
had already observed this, is that in the 70s, I think there were some papers in the

35:40.960 --> 35:48.840
Soviet Union about directly solving to find one of these, you know, dissipated quantities

35:48.840 --> 35:56.200
or a so-called Lyapunov function by numerical methods, which is, I think, you know, it's

35:56.200 --> 35:58.320
not a huge thing, but it's pretty cool, right?

35:58.320 --> 36:02.120
You know, up until that point, the way you've, I mean, look, let's think about the way people

36:02.120 --> 36:04.040
find Lyapunov functions, right?

36:04.040 --> 36:08.080
One is you start with physics and you say, well, let's just add the kinetic energy plus

36:08.080 --> 36:09.200
a potential energy.

36:09.200 --> 36:13.320
And that doesn't work, you add another term or two, and then voila, it worked.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.320
You got something, right?

36:14.320 --> 36:17.000
I mean, another method would be from optimal control.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.240
So you'd actually, you'd write down an optimal control problem and you'd work out, let's

36:22.240 --> 36:26.360
say, the value function of it.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.480
So these were the traditional ways, right, through analytical methods and other stuff.

36:30.480 --> 36:34.480
Anyway, so it's really interesting, the idea that you can actually compute them.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.920
And that's where I think convex optimization comes in, right?

36:37.920 --> 36:44.680
It turns out that in a whole lot of cases, you can actually compute these Lyapunov functions

36:44.680 --> 36:46.160
using convex optimization.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.320
And I think that's super interesting.

36:47.320 --> 36:51.960
By the way, I think it's under, you know, I look back at that book now and I'm a little

36:51.960 --> 36:52.960
bit horrified.

36:52.960 --> 36:58.800
I mean, I gave it to somebody the other day who was interested.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.800
I said, take a copy.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.040
But I had to warn them.

37:01.040 --> 37:06.920
I was like, look, you know, full disclosure, you know, it's really technical and it's weird

37:06.920 --> 37:07.920
and all that.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.640
And it predated the term semi-definite programming.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.680
So we have some bizarre name for it, like the eigenvalue problem.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.680
So I just said, look, just heads up, this is not a fun book.

37:20.680 --> 37:25.160
But yeah, but I do think actually a lot of that stuff is super useful and actually hasn't

37:25.160 --> 37:27.480
been fully explored.

37:27.480 --> 37:32.240
So I'm actually wondering, do you think that is the last word on the topic or do you see

37:32.240 --> 37:34.960
a future for what is the next step?

37:34.960 --> 37:37.800
Honestly, I've been thinking about it on and off for a couple of years, but if I were going

37:37.800 --> 37:44.920
to do something really weird, I might go back to that and build, you know, build some beautiful

37:44.920 --> 37:48.040
software system for people to do that kind of stuff.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.920
I mean, there were, of course, there were things in the past that did this.

37:50.920 --> 37:55.560
There was this thing called LMI Lab or whatever, and there was a lot of other stuff driving

37:55.560 --> 37:56.560
it.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.920
But, you know, but just make it so that actually you could synthesize controllers and, you

37:59.920 --> 38:03.160
know, performance certificates this way.

38:03.160 --> 38:08.400
I mean, you, I think at one point you asked, you know, what were the essential ideas?

38:08.400 --> 38:10.800
There's actually another very powerful idea that's in there.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.480
And again, like many others, it can be traced way back.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.920
But the idea, you know, in the eighties and nineties and aughts, people were thinking

38:18.920 --> 38:23.640
a lot about, you know, verifying performance of something and the way we all know how this

38:23.640 --> 38:25.040
actually works in the real world.

38:25.040 --> 38:28.840
The way it works in the real world is someone designs a controller and they put some saturation

38:28.840 --> 38:32.960
in and then they tweak this gain and they do that and they do this and they gain schedule

38:32.960 --> 38:36.960
something and what they fiddle around and then they simulate it with a high fidelity

38:36.960 --> 38:39.360
simulator on a lot of stuff.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.440
And after a while they declare, I think it works.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.440
There it is.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.440
Right.

38:43.440 --> 38:48.520
And then they pass this controller over the wall to, you know, some control theorist who's,

38:48.520 --> 38:53.040
you know, typically hiding in the back room, right back room, meaning they're in a place

38:53.040 --> 38:54.880
where they should never come out in public.

38:54.880 --> 38:55.880
Right.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.000
Which I, which I think is probably the correct way to handle most control theorists.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Anyway.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.560
So they throw the policy over the wall to this control theorist and they say, please

39:03.560 --> 39:06.840
verify this, please validate it.

39:06.840 --> 39:07.840
Right.

39:07.840 --> 39:11.320
And, you know, you, it's interesting, I mean, you can try and you can do all sorts of stuff

39:11.320 --> 39:16.440
and you know, but it turns out, I think one thing you can conclude and one way to interpret

39:16.440 --> 39:21.320
the entirety of all the LMI stuff is to say, that's the wrong way to do it.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.760
You don't do it sequentially.

39:22.760 --> 39:29.200
The right way to do it is to co-design the policy or controller and the certificate or

39:29.200 --> 39:31.040
proof of correctness.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.040
You co-design them.

39:32.040 --> 39:38.560
And in fact, an even cooler and more advanced view, which I think people probably knew this

39:38.560 --> 39:44.760
in the 60s or 70s, is you design the proof of correctness first and then the controller

39:44.760 --> 39:46.280
will fall out from it.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.280
Right.

39:47.280 --> 39:51.120
So if I produce a control Lyapunov function or an approximate, that's the idea behind

39:51.120 --> 39:53.000
approximate dynamic programming.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Right.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.400
And incredibly powerful idea, I think.

39:57.400 --> 40:03.200
And I guess this is very much related to some of your most recent work on COCP.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.040
Is that fair to say?

40:05.040 --> 40:06.040
It is fair to say.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.040
Yeah.

40:07.520 --> 40:12.960
So COCP is Convex Optimization Control Policy.

40:12.960 --> 40:17.760
And it's a broad term for a policy in sequential decision making.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.200
Could be a controller, but it could also be a trading engine.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.200
It could be all sorts of other stuff.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.720
It could be an alarm system.

40:23.720 --> 40:28.680
So I'm thinking of control in a very broad way here.

40:28.680 --> 40:32.880
And it basically embeds a convex optimization problem that you solve.

40:32.880 --> 40:33.880
Right.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.680
And, you know, I mean, there's lots of examples of this.

40:35.680 --> 40:39.920
I mean, in traditional control, you'd have MPC, which has been done, I think, since the

40:39.920 --> 40:40.920
late 70s.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.920
MPC and like chemical process control.

40:43.920 --> 40:48.720
And it's really fascinating, right, that you actually, you solve this complicated problem

40:48.720 --> 40:51.000
and then that tells you your current action.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.360
And then 15 minutes later, you do it again.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.360
It's cool.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.840
For the audience, I should probably just add what it perhaps is MPC just for everybody

40:58.840 --> 41:00.080
to be on the same page.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.560
So model predictive control, it's just, I guess the main idea there is really to solve

41:04.640 --> 41:10.680
an optimal control problem recursively, iteratively, and that turns out to be a very good idea

41:10.680 --> 41:11.680
in practice.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.680
Yeah.

41:12.680 --> 41:15.280
This is the very, very short sales speech, I would say.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.280
Yeah.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.240
But you were saying something about convex optimization policies.

41:18.240 --> 41:23.720
I find that concept quite interesting and in a way also revolutionary.

41:23.720 --> 41:30.560
I was watching a keynote that you gave at L4DC in 2022, and there was a fantastic, controversial

41:30.560 --> 41:37.440
statement there that goes like, tuned COCP, so convex optimization control policies, is

41:37.440 --> 41:41.080
the PID controller of the 21st century.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.080
Can you elaborate on this?

41:42.080 --> 41:43.080
I can.

41:43.080 --> 41:49.480
So this is one of the things that you come to appreciate in control, and it's a really

41:49.480 --> 41:52.480
cool fact about our field, and I think we should accept it and embrace it.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.520
I think it's really awesome.

41:53.520 --> 42:02.440
It's this, is that incredibly simple sounding algorithms can be unbelievably effective in

42:02.440 --> 42:03.440
practice.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.680
You know, PID controller is one of them, right?

42:06.680 --> 42:12.120
And it's very funny when you go to a fancy control thing and you'd be hearing a lot of

42:12.120 --> 42:17.280
theory and some fancy new robust controller and stuff like that.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.360
It's just kind of, it's good grounding to think every now and then about things like

42:20.360 --> 42:22.820
PID controller, lead lag control.

42:22.820 --> 42:26.620
So I thought your definition of MPC was very good.

42:26.620 --> 42:33.460
I want to put it in maybe a less fancy way to say it, because I see it, actually, it's

42:33.460 --> 42:36.220
used in many, many fields with different names, right?

42:36.220 --> 42:40.940
So the way, at the highest level, I would say it goes like this, right?

42:40.940 --> 42:42.340
You know, you want to take an action.

42:42.340 --> 42:43.780
It's for sequential decision making.

42:43.780 --> 42:47.100
So you know, you can act right now, and there's stuff that you know, and there's stuff you

42:47.100 --> 42:48.100
don't know.

42:48.100 --> 42:50.140
Like you don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future.

42:50.140 --> 42:53.300
You probably have some idea, but you don't know exactly.

42:53.300 --> 42:57.300
And so the first thing you do is you get a forecast.

42:57.300 --> 42:58.300
And it's ridiculous.

42:58.300 --> 43:00.820
It's a single forecast of what's going to happen in the future, right?

43:00.820 --> 43:07.020
You say, this is the way I think energy prices and demand are going to be moving in the next

43:07.020 --> 43:08.020
48 hours.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.180
Like that's a prediction.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.780
And someone says, wow, do you believe it?

43:11.780 --> 43:13.780
And you're like, no, of course not.

43:13.780 --> 43:14.780
It's just a forecast.

43:14.780 --> 43:16.580
I mean, come on, right?

43:16.580 --> 43:18.460
Okay, then you do this.

43:18.460 --> 43:19.660
It sounds so naive.

43:19.660 --> 43:20.660
It's unbelievable.

43:20.660 --> 43:21.660
You then do the following.

43:21.660 --> 43:22.660
You say, okay, well, guess what?

43:22.660 --> 43:26.540
I'm going to create myself a plan of action, assuming my single forecast is completely

43:26.540 --> 43:27.540
correct.

43:27.540 --> 43:29.340
And you're like, that makes no sense.

43:29.340 --> 43:32.220
It doesn't make, it's like, this is not going to work, right?

43:32.220 --> 43:33.220
Okay.

43:33.220 --> 43:36.300
And then you say, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a plan of action.

43:36.300 --> 43:39.100
You take the first step in that plan of action.

43:39.100 --> 43:42.100
And that's what I'm going to do today, or for this 15 minute period.

43:42.100 --> 43:43.420
Then they say, well, what happens next 15?

43:43.420 --> 43:44.420
Well, you see, I do the same thing.

43:44.420 --> 43:47.060
I get updated forecasts, I replan.

43:47.060 --> 43:51.220
And then, of course, there's a lot of theory around it, which is, frankly, a little bit

43:51.220 --> 43:52.220
silly.

43:52.220 --> 43:56.460
I mean, it is nice to know that it kind of works in some silly cases, right?

43:56.460 --> 44:02.020
But I think the most important fact about it is something like PI and PID, when it's

44:02.020 --> 44:06.580
done correctly, it works extremely well, thank you.

44:06.580 --> 44:07.900
If you think about it, I mean, it's hilarious.

44:07.900 --> 44:12.660
It's used in finance, where it's called multi-period trading or something, right?

44:12.660 --> 44:16.860
And that's hilarious, because the entire point about finance is precisely that you do not

44:16.860 --> 44:17.860
know the future.

44:17.860 --> 44:22.420
You know, if I knew future returns, like, I mean, I don't know, I have friends who say

44:22.420 --> 44:26.620
if you can get the sign right 52% of the time, you can make money, right?

44:26.620 --> 44:29.380
So the point is, you very much don't know the future.

44:29.380 --> 44:33.660
And yet, you know, in the right hands, there it is working in finance.

44:33.660 --> 44:37.260
So I remember I talked to someone in supply chain.

44:37.260 --> 44:38.260
This is how they do it.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.260
This is what supply chain does.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.900
I mean, of course it is, right?

44:40.900 --> 44:44.860
You make forecasts of product demands, right?

44:44.860 --> 44:49.500
And then you figure out, like, what stuff should you ship where and, you know, all that

44:49.500 --> 44:50.500
kind of stuff.

44:50.500 --> 44:53.660
And you're taking into account a lot of cool stuff, like, you know, the cost of trucking

44:53.660 --> 44:59.100
things or transporting things from one place to another, the capacity in a warehouse, the

44:59.100 --> 45:01.660
amount of labor you have available to do X, Y, or Z.

45:01.660 --> 45:04.220
So it's, you know, very sophisticated.

45:04.220 --> 45:07.700
But it's based entirely on forecasts, you know, a week, a month, or, you know, even

45:07.700 --> 45:10.020
sometimes an hour out.

45:10.020 --> 45:13.020
It does seem to be the most intuitive thing to do, actually.

45:13.020 --> 45:14.020
It is.

45:14.020 --> 45:17.940
And I remember I talked to someone who's an expert on supply chain stuff.

45:17.940 --> 45:24.500
And I said, what do you call it when you make a forecast, then make a plan of action, pretending

45:24.500 --> 45:29.180
that your forecast is correct, take the first step, and then repeat the whole thing one

45:29.180 --> 45:30.820
time step later?

45:30.820 --> 45:34.700
I said, you know, we, I said, we call, you know, I said, in my field, we call this, you

45:34.700 --> 45:39.940
know, model predictive control, dynamic matrix control, you know, all, you know, receding

45:39.940 --> 45:40.940
horizon control.

45:40.940 --> 45:42.580
I said, we have lots of names for it.

45:42.580 --> 45:43.580
What do you call it?

45:43.580 --> 45:44.820
And he just looked, stared straight at me.

45:44.820 --> 45:47.700
And he said, yeah, I said, like, what in supply chain?

45:47.700 --> 45:48.700
I don't know that dialect.

45:48.700 --> 45:49.700
What do you call it?

45:49.700 --> 45:54.940
And he just looked at me and he said, we call that supply chain optimization.

45:54.940 --> 45:58.300
The point, the point being, like, what else would you do, right?

45:58.300 --> 45:59.980
Like, what else could you possibly?

45:59.980 --> 46:00.980
So it was cool.

46:00.980 --> 46:06.900
I also had a, had a hilarious conversation with a friend of mine who is a CFO of a company.

46:06.900 --> 46:09.860
So we're just chit-chatting, you know, about what CFOs do.

46:09.860 --> 46:10.860
And guess what they do?

46:10.860 --> 46:15.980
He said, basically, by the time we finished talking, he said, that's 80% of my job.

46:15.980 --> 46:16.980
That's what I do.

46:16.980 --> 46:19.260
It's just, he said, he said, now I know the name for it.

46:19.260 --> 46:20.260
It's MPC.

46:20.260 --> 46:21.260
Yeah.

46:21.260 --> 46:22.260
He said, look, here's what I do.

46:22.260 --> 46:27.740
I get, I get multiple forecasts of, you know, demand for our product, costs, right?

46:27.740 --> 46:32.260
I know we're opening a new facility in Austin next year, and that's going to cost X.

46:32.260 --> 46:36.660
We forecast, you know, revenue, we forecast growth, you know, all sorts of stuff, like

46:36.660 --> 46:40.180
many quarters out, like six, eight quarters out, right?

46:40.180 --> 46:42.180
And he said, yeah, we don't believe those.

46:42.180 --> 46:44.580
He said, in fact, we typically make three forecasts, right?

46:44.580 --> 46:50.340
Kind of a median one, kind of a poor outcome, like, you know, low revenue and high expenses,

46:50.340 --> 46:51.340
right?

46:51.340 --> 46:57.300
And then, you know, when they sometimes label bliss, which is like a, you know, and yeah.

46:57.300 --> 46:59.740
And then he said, we make a complete plan.

46:59.740 --> 47:01.060
I present it to the board.

47:01.060 --> 47:02.660
That's what we do.

47:02.660 --> 47:09.580
And no one on the board believes that your revenue forecast four quarters out is going

47:09.580 --> 47:10.580
to be right.

47:10.580 --> 47:11.820
No one believes that.

47:11.820 --> 47:12.820
No one.

47:12.820 --> 47:18.400
So, but the cool part is everyone understands you do this plan, so you don't do something

47:18.400 --> 47:22.120
now that's going to put you in a bad position in the future.

47:22.120 --> 47:25.140
And that's really the essential idea.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.140
That's crazy.

47:26.140 --> 47:31.620
And it seems to apply to at any scale in a way, also like at a political scale, for example.

47:31.620 --> 47:32.740
It does.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.580
In many other domains.

47:34.580 --> 47:39.020
But maybe just to go back to convex optimization control policies.

47:39.020 --> 47:44.440
How do those relate to, let's say, MPC that we just discussed extensively and other things

47:44.440 --> 47:45.740
that we mentioned before?

47:45.740 --> 47:51.420
MPC, model predictive control, is simply an instance of a convex optimization control

47:51.420 --> 47:52.420
policy.

47:52.420 --> 47:57.060
It's a policy where you solve a problem to decide an action.

47:57.060 --> 47:59.220
And in this case, you solve it over horizon.

47:59.220 --> 48:00.220
There are a lot of others.

48:00.220 --> 48:06.460
I mean, one is approximate dynamic programming is another classic example of that.

48:06.460 --> 48:10.380
But there are lots of other things where, a lot of these things have parameters in them

48:10.380 --> 48:13.060
that you can use to tune, right?

48:13.060 --> 48:16.980
This is not at all unlike PID, where you have three parameters to tune.

48:16.980 --> 48:20.020
You have a lot more than three parameters to tune in these things.

48:20.020 --> 48:21.860
Actually, that's not true.

48:21.860 --> 48:26.980
In some cases, you would have hyperparameters, and there might only be a few, right?

48:26.980 --> 48:32.780
Like if you're doing finance, you might have a term hyperparameter that scales the risk

48:32.780 --> 48:39.460
cost, or another hyperparameter that scales the transaction cost, right?

48:39.460 --> 48:45.820
And as senior people in control told me decades ago, the right way to think of these parameters,

48:45.820 --> 48:51.020
they were of course referring to like LQG, is they said, these are knobs that you turn

48:51.180 --> 48:52.980
to make the controller do what you like.

48:52.980 --> 48:55.660
And it's this identical principle here, right?

48:55.660 --> 49:00.820
So people have made convex optimization control policies for a while.

49:00.820 --> 49:04.700
It's growing, I think, or it appears to be.

49:04.700 --> 49:09.260
Part of it is the relentless improvement in computers, right?

49:09.260 --> 49:13.340
So that doesn't hurt us at all, I should say, right?

49:13.340 --> 49:14.340
Everything's based on that.

49:14.340 --> 49:16.340
But a lot of the tuning was done by hand.

49:16.340 --> 49:20.940
And that's actually, if you've got three hyperparameters, why not, right?

49:21.860 --> 49:28.340
What's interesting is even something like 10 or 20 or 30 hyperparameters is a case where

49:28.340 --> 49:33.140
you can tune that policy to make it do what you want.

49:33.140 --> 49:38.020
And so I think that's what a tuned COCP policy is.

49:38.020 --> 49:42.220
And what's, I think, kind of exciting is not theoretical, because everyone knows about

49:42.220 --> 49:45.820
all this and knows that this is the general program.

49:45.820 --> 49:51.300
I think the most exciting part about it actually is the infrastructure and ecosystem being

49:51.300 --> 49:54.700
built out to actually do this, right?

49:54.700 --> 49:56.820
So we'll talk about that, I imagine.

49:56.820 --> 49:57.820
We'll talk about CVXPi.

49:57.820 --> 49:58.820
Definitely.

49:58.820 --> 49:59.820
Definitely.

49:59.820 --> 50:00.820
But to me, that's the most interesting part.

50:00.820 --> 50:05.460
I mean, I'm just wondering, I'm going to put myself in the shoes of the audience.

50:05.460 --> 50:12.900
And could we conceptualize COCPs as essentially parametric convex optimization programs in

50:12.980 --> 50:16.340
the parameter being the control policy in a way?

50:16.340 --> 50:18.740
Would that be fair to say?

50:18.740 --> 50:21.300
Maybe not quite.

50:21.300 --> 50:26.380
So there are two types of parameters in a convex optimization control policy.

50:26.380 --> 50:31.700
One, it tells you the context, and that's typically like the state or the inputs.

50:31.700 --> 50:36.140
Or if someone says, no, I changed my mind, here's your target over here, right?

50:36.140 --> 50:37.620
That's one.

50:37.620 --> 50:42.740
And the second are parameters that affect the policy.

50:42.740 --> 50:45.020
Which you don't expect to change very often.

50:45.020 --> 50:46.260
And as a matter of fact, in...

50:46.260 --> 50:49.100
This would be the Qs and Rs, for example, in LQR.

50:49.100 --> 50:50.100
You got it.

50:50.100 --> 50:51.100
Exactly.

50:51.100 --> 50:55.260
And to be honest with you, in most legitimate applications, you don't change those at all.

50:55.260 --> 50:58.580
I mean, you know, whatever, except with a software update or whatever it is you want

50:58.580 --> 51:00.860
to do, right?

51:00.860 --> 51:01.860
That's the safe model.

51:01.860 --> 51:02.860
So...

51:02.860 --> 51:03.860
It sounds super interesting.

51:03.860 --> 51:09.260
And I guess the ecosystem that you were referring to before has to do with the enormous amount

51:09.260 --> 51:13.700
of software that you have produced, again, in your, I wouldn't even say double life,

51:13.700 --> 51:16.500
but triple life or fourth life.

51:16.500 --> 51:21.500
So your first endeavor in that direction, I guess, was CVX in 2008.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.500
That's right.

51:22.500 --> 51:29.020
But then it sparked into a whole, as you said, ecosystem of different types of frameworks.

51:29.020 --> 51:36.660
So for example, CVX-Gen, CVX-Pi, you also have a Julia version as well, CVX-R, OSQP.

51:37.540 --> 51:40.420
I'm pretty sure I didn't mention even half of them.

51:40.420 --> 51:41.420
Is that right?

51:41.420 --> 51:42.420
You're right.

51:42.420 --> 51:43.420
You didn't.

51:43.420 --> 51:44.420
It's okay, though.

51:44.420 --> 51:45.420
It's fine.

51:45.420 --> 51:46.420
I'm curious there.

51:46.420 --> 51:51.780
I mean, I guess this is also the result of your interest in how to apply all the theoretical

51:51.780 --> 51:53.700
concepts that you developed.

51:53.700 --> 52:00.340
But also, the concept that I found most interesting there was the idea of disciplined programming,

52:00.340 --> 52:01.340
convex programming.

52:01.340 --> 52:02.340
Right.

52:02.340 --> 52:04.860
Can you elaborate on what that concept means for our audience?

52:04.860 --> 52:05.860
Oh, I can.

52:06.060 --> 52:11.020
So, you know, I was going around being a pain in the ass to people about convex optimization,

52:11.020 --> 52:14.620
both before the development of these tools and after.

52:14.620 --> 52:16.380
And it would go like this.

52:16.380 --> 52:18.820
I'd be all, I mean, I think about it now, it'd be awful.

52:18.820 --> 52:22.900
Like I'd go somewhere and someone would say like, okay, here's my problem and I want to

52:22.900 --> 52:24.340
do X, Y, and Z.

52:24.340 --> 52:25.340
And I'd come up to them afterwards.

52:25.340 --> 52:26.620
I'd say, hey, guess what?

52:26.620 --> 52:28.620
Your problem's convex optimization problem.

52:28.620 --> 52:29.620
And they'd say, so?

52:29.620 --> 52:31.500
And I'd say, so it means we can solve it.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.440
And they'd say, so how do I do that?

52:33.440 --> 52:36.920
And the truth was, in those days, it's kind of a pain in the ass, right?

52:36.920 --> 52:39.920
Because you have to, you know, write all, I said, well, you just get yourself a grad

52:39.920 --> 52:44.680
student and, you know, have them write up all this horrible code and it's hard to debug

52:44.680 --> 52:47.300
and translate it to some standard form.

52:47.300 --> 52:51.480
Then you link it to some solver, whatever at the time, you know.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.680
So it just wasn't that easy.

52:53.680 --> 52:57.680
And I remember a lot of times, even when I had come up to someone and said, look, we

52:57.680 --> 52:59.520
could just solve your problem.

52:59.520 --> 53:02.520
A lot of those people just thought I was a crazy person, but that's another story.

53:02.600 --> 53:07.240
But even the ones who said, yeah, I think you're right, it just, the barrier to entry

53:07.240 --> 53:09.280
was just too high.

53:09.280 --> 53:14.640
It just involved, you know, tons of coding and C and C++ to link something and all that

53:14.640 --> 53:16.160
sort of stuff.

53:16.160 --> 53:22.400
So the, you know, the idea behind discipline convex programming is, the short description

53:22.400 --> 53:23.400
is this.

53:23.400 --> 53:30.480
It is a system for basically normal people or relatively normal people to be able to

53:30.480 --> 53:36.560
specify and then solve a wide, very wide variety of convex optimization problems.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
Right?

53:37.560 --> 53:40.600
So the contract is very simple.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.160
It's this.

53:42.160 --> 53:50.880
You the user will accept basically extreme, extreme limitations on what you can express.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.200
Okay?

53:52.200 --> 53:55.520
Here's what we pay you if you honor that contract.

53:55.520 --> 53:59.800
Then what we will do is we will faithfully translate your problem to a standard form

54:00.120 --> 54:03.720
problem and solve it globally and give you the solution.

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
Right?

54:04.720 --> 54:05.720
That's the contract.

54:05.720 --> 54:11.640
And, you know, it's actually, I mean, it's not too dissimilar from the question of trying

54:11.640 --> 54:14.160
to verify a controller.

54:14.160 --> 54:19.880
You might imagine that the right way to use convex optimization in the field would be

54:19.880 --> 54:22.040
people just write their problem.

54:22.040 --> 54:26.040
And then, you know, some computer would look at it and try to argue and figure out if it's

54:26.040 --> 54:27.040
convex or not.

54:27.280 --> 54:30.480
And it turns out that's actually a truly terrible idea.

54:30.480 --> 54:35.040
The right way to do it is to say there's a very short language.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.840
As a matter of fact, there's exactly one rule, which is crazy.

54:38.840 --> 54:39.840
So there's just one rule.

54:39.840 --> 54:45.080
And if you follow, if you faithfully follow this one rule, when you form your problem,

54:45.080 --> 54:49.960
then we guarantee we can faithfully translate it and then it can be solved.

54:49.960 --> 54:54.680
And, you know, it's very different from so-called nonlinear optimization, right?

54:54.680 --> 54:59.080
Because in so-called nonlinear optimization, you can do anything you like.

54:59.080 --> 55:01.300
Type in whatever you like.

55:01.300 --> 55:04.320
But now then the solving it, the modeling is easy.

55:04.320 --> 55:06.320
And now the solving is like an art.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.240
And in fact, in most cases, you can't even do it.

55:08.240 --> 55:13.880
Anyway, so the idea of DCP is we just say, here's a simple rule.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.040
You follow this rule.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.240
We solve your problem.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.240
Period.

55:18.240 --> 55:22.640
And, you know, so we built a bunch of software implementations of this.

55:22.640 --> 55:24.000
And it's fun to watch it grow.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.400
And it's very widely used.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.800
It's kind of awesome.

55:27.800 --> 55:28.800
It's incredible.

55:28.800 --> 55:32.120
I myself was a user of many of these tools.

55:32.120 --> 55:36.320
And I can definitely vouch for the fact that it's incredibly easy to use.

55:36.320 --> 55:40.400
And that's perhaps where the success of these tools lies.

55:40.400 --> 55:45.320
So I was wondering, how do you actually make somehow these frameworks?

55:45.320 --> 55:50.880
I would imagine that it can be posed as programming language free, in a sense, because programming

55:50.880 --> 55:55.720
keeps on changing, in the sense of programming languages keep on changing, they keep on

55:55.720 --> 55:57.240
being updated.

55:57.240 --> 56:02.040
But how does one actually remains robust, let's say, to these changes?

56:02.040 --> 56:05.680
So, you know, what's interesting is this goes back to the stuff we talked about before,

56:05.680 --> 56:09.600
which was the value in practice of theory, right?

56:09.600 --> 56:14.060
That you could imagine just basically hacking something together that says, oh, if you see

56:14.060 --> 56:16.000
min or max, do this, right?

56:16.000 --> 56:19.320
If you see the square, the square root, do this transformation.

56:19.320 --> 56:22.480
And the point is, a system like that, it would probably never work.

56:22.480 --> 56:25.440
I mean, it might appear to work at some point, but it doesn't really.

56:25.440 --> 56:31.520
So DCP, Discipline Convex Programming, is built from an extremely small mathematical

56:31.520 --> 56:32.980
core, right?

56:32.980 --> 56:36.720
And the result is that with high probability, it's actually correct.

56:36.720 --> 56:39.280
Now what's interesting is implementing that core.

56:39.280 --> 56:40.920
And by the way, CVX was not the first one.

56:40.920 --> 56:46.400
I would say the first one was YALMIP, which was, you know, yet another LMI processor,

56:46.400 --> 56:47.400
which preceded it.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.200
It's very, very cool.

56:49.200 --> 56:52.160
Anyway, you know, the basic idea is very simple.

56:52.160 --> 56:57.000
When we first did this in like MATLAB, you know, quite a while ago, they had just barely

56:57.000 --> 57:01.120
introduced object oriented things, and it didn't really work and wasn't consistent and

57:01.120 --> 57:02.120
blah, blah, blah.

57:02.120 --> 57:04.600
And so it was actually kind of a pain to implement it.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.280
Of course, that was Michael Grant, who did that.

57:07.280 --> 57:13.980
You know, so what's happened is, as languages get more and more sophisticated, it gets easier

57:13.980 --> 57:15.240
and easier to solve.

57:15.240 --> 57:20.000
In Julia, for example, you know, which has the advantage of being a relatively recently

57:20.000 --> 57:25.560
developed language, the core of convex.jl, it's like 40, 50 lines.

57:25.560 --> 57:29.680
And you're like, how could that be?

57:29.680 --> 57:35.040
And the reason is that the language supports these very high level abstractions, right?

57:35.040 --> 57:37.080
So to me, that's actually really cool.

57:37.080 --> 57:43.040
The idea that, you know, you go back to like C and Fortran, and I don't know, you can do

57:43.040 --> 57:46.760
things like, you know, multiply two numbers, you know, and then shove them back into this

57:46.760 --> 57:49.120
memory location or something like that, right?

57:49.120 --> 57:56.760
I mean, but what's amazing is the new languages support incredible abstraction.

57:56.760 --> 58:01.320
That's awesome for people like us, who use math to do practical things, because it means

58:01.320 --> 58:07.080
you can actually express like really complicated things, or things that would be complicated

58:07.080 --> 58:09.600
in just a handful of lines of code.

58:09.600 --> 58:13.080
And I'm curious about like the future trends that you actually foresee.

58:13.080 --> 58:18.000
So for example, do you have any thoughts on the role of, say, AI in completing our own

58:18.000 --> 58:25.440
programs or what is the next big thing in solving the next type of most expressive optimization

58:25.440 --> 58:26.440
problem?

58:26.440 --> 58:27.440
I don't know.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.760
What are your thoughts on monitoring operators?

58:28.760 --> 58:32.240
There are so many questions that I still have, it's incredible.

58:32.240 --> 58:40.400
So first of all, things like, you know, a chat GPT is amazing, including the code generation

58:40.400 --> 58:41.400
portion of it.

58:41.400 --> 58:44.520
It's just, it's, it's actually amazing.

58:44.520 --> 58:46.280
It's awe inspiring.

58:46.280 --> 58:52.600
And it's super interesting, like, you know, we've played with it, and it's actually super,

58:52.600 --> 58:57.320
what it does is it generates things that sound completely correct, and usually are completely

58:57.320 --> 58:58.520
wrong.

58:58.520 --> 59:03.880
So which, but it's actually, to me, it was even a little bit disturbing, because I usually,

59:03.880 --> 59:09.360
you know, in looking at students work, I usually associate poor writing with being wrong, and

59:09.360 --> 59:11.880
good writing with being right.

59:11.880 --> 59:17.520
And here was very good writing, but the logic and math was just completely wrong.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.000
So now, by the way, I don't mean that as a criticism.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.800
It's just that, you know, when they were training this thing, and you know, that no one said

59:24.800 --> 59:30.280
that you should have a very negative reward for asserting something that's false, right?

59:30.280 --> 59:33.360
You know, so if it sticks to interpretations and things like that, it's great.

59:33.360 --> 59:37.880
And I, my suspicion is within a year or two, we'll see systems, you know, large language

59:37.880 --> 59:44.600
models that will actually do really well, and will generally speaking, not make false

59:44.600 --> 59:45.600
arguments.

59:45.600 --> 59:47.080
So I think it's just amazing.

59:47.080 --> 59:52.520
It is definitely interesting also to imagine different types of uses of these tools, for

59:52.520 --> 59:55.360
example, in other domains, like music, even.

59:55.360 --> 01:00:00.000
One can imagine that we could use them for a sculpture, for example, we feed them a bunch

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.240
of images for 3D printers, and then they're going to create something totally new.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.560
Yeah, I'm very fascinated as well.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.580
And I'm curious, what's the role that you see there of optimization?

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.680
Because it's definitely there under the hood.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.440
Well, certainly, it's entirely based on, you know, well, it's SGD, stochastic gradient

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.480
descent under the hood on, you know, 100 billion parameter models.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.200
So but I know that's kind of a cheap thing.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.200
We all know that.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.080
We all know that that's how it works, right?

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.600
And that's not why it works, although it's a critical component of it.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.900
So I think it'll be a very interesting, in a way, people were talking about, you know,

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.480
we build things like CVXPi, so that you can in 10 lines, you know, you'd take a little

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.720
bit of training and in 10 lines, you can describe and very sophisticated novel problems and

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.200
have it solved, right?

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:54.600
We have code generation tools, like CVXGen, or CVXPiGen, that's a newer version of CVXGen.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.200
And then you'd say, okay, I like what I'm seeing in simulation, please generate me real

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.900
time code, I can dump onto my drone or whatever it is, right?

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:08.420
So I think it's cool to have these high level tools that will simplify a lot of what used

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.200
to be, you know, basically a lot of work.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.480
So people I've, I mean, actually, my students and colleagues were thinking like, this would

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480
be awesome.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.280
Like, you just talk to this thing and say, here's what it looks like.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.280
In fact, why don't you go fit a model to the dynamics?

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280
And it would do it.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.680
And then you'd say, okay, let's make a controller, show me some simulations with your controller.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.720
And you go, no, no, no, no, I don't like it, it's too rough a ride.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.960
And then it would, you know, add a term penalizing ride roughness, right?

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.400
And so I can imagine like crazy stuff that would be really cool.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.880
And it would eventually just kick out, like real time code, you can run on your drone

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.880
or whatever it is, right?

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.000
I guess the interesting question then will become again, verification.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.240
So how does one guarantee that whatever is produced is actually complying with some sort

01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.880
of performance measure that we, the users specify?

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:06.400
And I wonder whether we should be content with probability one, or I'm not sure.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400
Yeah.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.000
So I guess that's, I mean, I have a specific idea about how I think convex optimization

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.760
and for example, neural networks should play.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.240
They both play incredibly important roles.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.420
They both do some things super well, right?

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:24.360
And I can give you an example and I'll take an example from finance, right?

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.560
Here's something that is just idiotic and does not work.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:33.240
Like train a neural network that goes directly from Twitter feeds to a trade list, literally

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.000
telling you what to buy and sell.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That's like idiotic.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.240
Like, why would you do that, right?

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.680
The correct way to do it is take a neural network that basically takes in some like

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.200
very complicated data like Twitter feeds and all sorts of other stuff, and then predicts,

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.480
let's say one day and five day forward returns.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.360
That's a perfect use of it.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:03.680
That is then plugged in to a convex optimization solver that weighs the risk, the transaction

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.680
costs, the constraints, and then from those, it generates the trade list.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.520
Nice thing about the convex optimization part is we know what it does.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.400
It can't do anything crazy.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.160
Whatever it does, it does for a reason.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.800
We know how to make it robust.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.760
We understand precisely what it does.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:25.200
And in fact, it can be made so reliable that it just runs real time without any human intervention.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.080
So you have the neural network making very sophisticated forecasts, ones that would be

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.880
very difficult to do using other methods.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.040
And then that feeds into some, you know, MPC or something like that.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.840
So to me, that seems like the right way for these two technologies to play together.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:48.240
Maybe that is the future actually of the interplay of control with machine learning that is nowadays

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.880
the elephant in the room for us control theorists, because it seems to work so well in certain

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.000
domains that it's impossible to ignore it.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Absolutely.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.280
I think maybe it's time to shift gears a little bit.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:08.200
I was definitely struck by your IEEE Control Systems Award acceptance speech, which I believe

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.720
appeared on CSM, the Control Systems magazine.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.600
And there there's a fantastic quote that I definitely have to read.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.320
It goes as follows.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320
For me, teaching is research.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.640
Teaching is storytelling.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.360
And the story behind the research is important.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.360
The story should be simple and compelling with substance and maybe a few subplots.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.880
And it should bring people in, not keep people away, for example, by using some esoteric

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:37.320
field specific dialect or acronyms or assuming that the reader has fully absorbed all details

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.040
of the last few papers.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.040
I think that's great.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.520
And I'd like you to elaborate a bit on this.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520
Sure.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.120
What are your thoughts on teaching?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.120
Yeah.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:51.240
So, I mean, I really don't distinguish very much between teaching and research in both

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240
cases.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.500
And again, it comes back to the, I guess, this training in math and this aesthetic that

01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:00.580
what you want is intellectual economy, right?

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:04.460
So no one wants to hear somebody come in and say, oh, there's this method and that method.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.460
And then you could do this.

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.460
And oh, is it Tuesday?

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.460
Okay.

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.620
We can tell you about, you know, reverse conjugate gradients and blah, blah.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:15.020
It's like, you know, I think when you hear that, it tells me that this person is kind

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.020
of confused inside, right?

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.900
What you really want is to get it down to its essence.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.380
And it's not, this is not easy work to try to figure out, you know, what are the three

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380
concepts?

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.820
A lot of it involves intellectual triage.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.900
You know, when you see all these fights about the curriculum, you know, in various fields,

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.900
like let's say EE for one, right?

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.980
And someone would say, well, we can't throw out that topic and we can't throw out that

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.380
topic because we taught it for a hundred years, but we have to teach these new topics.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.420
So and then you, you end up with this kind of, you know, garbled thing.

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:45.420
So you really have to do the triage.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:50.020
And the triage really means you're going to let some of that stuff just die anyway.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:57.380
So I think once you have a very clear picture of a field or a problem, number one, then

01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.380
you can teach it.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.460
So that's the same thing, right?

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.860
You can actually look at a crowd of a couple of hundred people and explain it and have

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.820
them go, okay, yeah, I get it.

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.700
And actually it's a good thing if some of them said, really?

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.280
It's really that simple?

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.380
And then you look at them, you go, yep.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:15.820
So I'm sorry to be the one to tell you it's, it really is that simple.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:21.260
In this sense, do you have any advice to like, say, future instructors or future teachers

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.860
at any scale, I guess?

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.860
Yeah, I do.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:29.420
I mean, for me, teaching is intensely intellectual, right?

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:33.940
I mean, there's a performance aspect to it, like, and that's also super important.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.660
It has to, it actually has to do with control and feedback.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:43.620
But actually designing a lecture or a course or something like that is actually intensely

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620
intellectual, right?

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:49.060
What you really want is a clean story, right?

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.380
And maybe the details are complicated.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.880
And in the right social setting, it's fine to go into the details, right?

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.820
If you're with five other people who are experts on that field and you want to talk about some

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:05.540
weird, you know, constraint qualification thing and compactness of the dual, you know,

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.540
by all means, please do it.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.180
I mean, I'm assuming this is not in public, right?

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.820
So that should not be done in public.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:16.300
But, you know, I think other than that, you have to figure out, like, what are the main

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.740
things you're saying, and then organize it.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.420
And then it's actually, it's a whole lot easier to teach then, because you're teaching the

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.780
structure to the students.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:30.100
You know, it all goes back to this aesthetic of simplicity, right?

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:34.100
I guess this is extremely well demonstrated, not only in the books that we mentioned before,

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:39.060
but also in one of your most recent books, Introduction to Apply Linear Algebra.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.580
Of course, there will be a link in the description to all the books and publications that we

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.100
mentioned in the podcast.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:50.060
There you really take another level of abstraction and you make a wonderful exercise for people

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:53.700
to digest and understand linear algebra.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:59.340
For me, it was, I did read the book and it was extremely clear and very, very interesting

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:03.940
take also on it, because there were lots of applications coming in from all sorts of different

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.420
fields.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.980
Was that your goal in writing the book?

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.660
Yes, that's right.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.780
It was a fun book to write.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:15.260
I mean, it came about because, you know, I don't know, about five, ten years ago, maybe

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:19.620
ten years ago, I have a colleague and I was just complaining to him always about how terrible

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:24.140
the linear algebra teaching is and how people really, I mean, you don't even really, it's

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.940
much more important than knowing, for example, you know, calculus and all this kind of stuff.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.940
So I kept complaining.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:35.900
And at one point he turns to me at lunch and he says, look, you can either continue to

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:39.540
the end of your life complaining about linear algebra education, he said, or you can do

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.540
something about it.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.540
And I was like, yeah, okay.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.780
And at that moment, he got me.

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.740
So it was actually really fun.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.620
And it's actually, so the book, I mean, I like to think of it, you know, basically it's

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:57.580
an extremely elementary, very slow introduction to linear algebra.

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.540
It's all sorts of stuff we don't do.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.260
Like people say, you don't do SVD and you're like, that's right.

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.260
We don't.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:07.180
You don't do the determinant, rank, range, null space, fundamental theorem of linear

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.180
algebra.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.900
I was like, nope, nope, not a one.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.340
So we, it just focuses around basically least squares and what you can do with it.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.620
And you shouldn't make fun of that because, you know, a very large fraction of entire

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:24.180
industries are run on methods that, you know, are glorified forms of least squares and control

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.900
is one of them, to be perfectly honest.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.420
So I think of it as like, you know, the slow eating movement, you know, this is where you

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:37.100
don't run in and grab something, you know, you have a two or three hour, you know, lunch

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:41.420
and a four hour dinner and you, you actually savor each course, right?

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:45.780
So this is basically the slow linear algebra approach, right?

01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.620
I guess there's also like a basic philosophy behind it.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:54.020
So how many people do you want to draw in with respect to say, I want to say something

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.440
to a selected few.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.580
That is precisely right.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:00.580
So we call certain courses outreach courses.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:05.100
And first I'll tell you what, here's not an outreach course, a course on the most advanced

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:10.580
topics in information theory, you know, the seven papers published in the last year.

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.580
Okay.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.660
That's a perfectly good course.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:17.140
It's a great course, you know, and you've got your four students in it and it's great.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.140
Okay.

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.140
The opposite is an outreach course.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:25.580
And the idea there is to design a course that brings the essence of the ideas to an incredibly

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.900
wide group, people in many different departments and fields.

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.460
And there you really have to do the intellectual triage, right?

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.940
You can't tell them everything.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:38.300
So you really have to kind of think about what are the useful ideas and what are the

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.500
useful methods, right?

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.820
And so it's part of that.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:46.820
And so it was a really fun exercise, you know, for me and Lieven, my coauthor to do.

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:47.820
Yeah.

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:52.820
I guess also accessibility is a concept that is very much at the heart of your endeavor.

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:57.180
This is also reflected by the fact that everything that you produce is open source.

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.180
Is that right?

01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.180
That's right.

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:03.020
And you're potentially, well, one of the few that I have in mind that has all of his own

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:07.140
papers on his website are publicly available, including books.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:12.660
And I'm just curious, what is it that motivates you to go in the direction of open source?

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:18.140
Well, I think it's extremely important to advancing, I mean, this is good for everyone

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.980
is to make all this material available.

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:24.540
I think it, you know, it advances science and advances research.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:31.260
And I have gone to places, you know, where I would give a talk and I would have people

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.540
come up to me, you know, afterwards and say something like, you know, we want to especially

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:38.980
thank you for putting your convex optimization book online.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:45.460
And they said, because we can buy it, but the price is about two months salary, right?

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.260
And so, you know, I didn't think this through carefully.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.340
I would love to revise history and claim that I thought this through and it was a moral

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:57.300
decision and a, you know, rational anyway, honestly, we just fumbled into it.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.060
But I am also very happy that that's the way I've done it.

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:04.340
I guess another interesting segue to this is related to publishing.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:10.140
So I would be curious to hear your view about what are the right incentives in that direction

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:15.060
on modern publishing, let's say, and I'm curious about what are your thoughts on the social

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.500
aspect behind science as well?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.500
Right.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.180
There's a couple of different aspects of that question.

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:29.460
I mean, one is that there are these predatory publishing companies, you know, that basically

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.940
get essentially for free material from researchers and professors and, you know, this kind of

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:41.100
thing actually then have it reviewed for free by other professors and researchers, right?

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.440
I mean, even now the production costs are approximately zero.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.980
Then they create these things and then price them at appalling prices, knowing that there

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:56.660
is some inelastic demand, like, you know, various libraries are going to get a copy.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:01.940
And then in addition, I mean, this restricts the free flow of this information.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.580
So I think, you know, that's a very bad phenomenon.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:08.460
It's not going away fast enough for my taste, but I hope it does.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.460
Now there are some really good publishers, right?

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:17.820
Cambridge University Press is mine and I just think they are awesome in every way.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.660
I mean, you know, they do a lot and they add a lot.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.380
So I think that's one aspect, the problem with it.

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.980
By the way, it's not always the for-profit publishers, right?

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:33.220
There are nonprofit publishers that are basically not doing good stuff for science, right?

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:37.100
I'm not going to name any, but there are some and, you know, they're not, okay, they're

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.100
not in control.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:43.460
You know, like IEEE or something like that is on the ethical scale of publishing.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.620
You know, they're on the positive side.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.620
I think that's one aspect.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.740
I think the other aspect is that now that we have the ability to make stuff so widely

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.980
available, I think it's a great idea to do it.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.060
And I heard a talk at Stanford about this, about the effects, it was a talk in history

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:04.020
about the effects of the GI Bill, the General Infantry Bill.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.140
So after World War II, there were a lot of returning soldiers in the U.S.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.380
They didn't know what to do with them, so they sent them to college.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.180
And this was absolutely radical, right?

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.620
Before that time, you didn't send them to college, right?

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:19.100
It was like, that was for people who were rich or something like that, right?

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:24.100
And you know, lo and behold, it turns out that all those people who would not have gone

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:29.540
to college, some of them were really, really smart, right?

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.220
So she went on to name how a lot of these people went on to win Nobel prizes and things

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.220
like that.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.180
I mean, that's not a good end in itself, but still, I think it's that, right?

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:42.620
If you, you know, if you find some place where people don't have a lot of opportunities for

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:47.580
a wide variety of reasons, the idea that they can, I don't know, I love the idea that

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:54.260
somebody could be, right as we speak right now, I'm hoping some kids in various places

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:55.900
are reading the Linear Algebra book.

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.540
I just think that's awesome.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.180
And it's not just a cool thing to do.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.620
I think actually there'll be some really good benefits.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.980
Some of those people are going to grow up to do really great stuff.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:09.940
And hopefully they will listen also to this episode as well, and they'll be inspired.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.300
I hope so, yeah.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.300
So we're heading towards the end of this episode and in closing, I would like to ask you maybe

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:23.260
a couple of questions related to the future of convex optimization and control, or maybe

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.660
the intersection of both.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:30.660
And maybe I'll have another question related to advice that I tend to ask to any guest

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:36.220
that features on the show to future students, future students that happen to be in control

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.580
nowadays or planning to come in the field.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.180
What would be your best advice in general?

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.180
Yeah.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.180
So let's see.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.860
So the first question is about the future and like what's going on.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:52.140
And I have to say that, you know, what I'm focusing on is actually pretty pedestrian,

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.140
but I think it's important.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:57.340
So my focus and a lot of what our group does, I mean, we do fun stuff too, but a lot of

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:03.300
it is just to make sure that we build out the infrastructure that we need for very wide

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:07.260
groups of people to use these methods, right?

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.260
That's what we want to do.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:12.180
So if you look at some other fields, they have done so well at this.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:16.220
I mean, machine learning, unbelievable.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:21.980
The amount of open source material that's available and incredibly high quality open

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:23.700
source implementations of things.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.420
I mean, it's, I mean, anyway, my hat goes off to them.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.180
I mean, I think they've done a spectacular job.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:34.020
I personally think in optimization, we've done a less good job and in control, maybe

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.700
even worse than that.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.100
So and a lot of it is kind of pedestrian and boring.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.700
Like, you know, everybody knows how to implement a, you know, whatever, you know, a QP solver,

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.620
but you know, somebody has got to make one that's open source and reliable and works

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.620
and things like that.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.220
So we do a lot of that stuff.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:53.980
When you say these words, you have in mind things like TensorFlow, PyTorch or those kind

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.980
of things.

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.980
Yeah.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.980
Oh my God.

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.980
That's so good.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.380
I mean, you know, I think they've just done an incredibly good job.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.420
And, you know, if you think about it, there's nothing like that in control.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.980
Name the open source tools in control that people could use, right?

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.580
I mean, it's a simple question.

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.500
Like, I sit down with someone, I tell them what control is for like five minutes and

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.340
they go, this is awesome.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.340
This is awesome.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.740
I want to use this so-called control.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.780
Like, how do I do it?

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:21.780
Right?

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.460
Like, tell me, you know, what Git repo do I clone?

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.140
Or, you know, what do I need to pip install?

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.140
Right?

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.500
And the answer is, there's like nothing.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.340
I mean, there's commercial stuff, you know, which, you know, there's for profit stuff.

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.100
So, I mean, it's a little embarrassing for all feel and I'll be honest, I think it's

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.100
a little embarrassing.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:40.780
And then you asked about advice.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:44.020
And I would say to a student, and this is going to be very personal because it's what

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.380
I thought I wish someone had told me, you know, maybe it's also a character flaw on

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.380
my part.

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:53.380
But, you know, when I was young, I was very snobby and had very high standards and things

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.460
like that.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.620
And I kind of avoided things that were messy and, you know, a lot of the applied stuff

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.620
was messy and stuff like that.

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:07.540
And it was only much later that I realized how rich an experience you can have when you

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:12.020
learn all the math, but you also learn a lot about, you know, how it's applied and how

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.380
does this field work and how does that field work.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:20.180
So, my advice to young people is, you know, absolutely focus on the basics.

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.300
Absolutely do that.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.220
But also, you know, spend a little quality time as you, I think you used the word traveling.

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.820
So, doing some intellectual traveling.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.060
Go, just, you know, go over to the mountain to the next village and see what they're up

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060
to.

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:37.980
You know, maybe if you only go one village, they'll speak a similar dialect, you can figure

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.980
out what they're doing.

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:43.900
And because I just think that's so enriching, you know, when you come back to know how people

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.700
in different fields use math.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.220
I think it's super interesting.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.860
That would be my advice.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:53.820
What do you think is the best way to make this happen in a way?

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:59.220
Because it's something that I tend to observe in many, many students nowadays, the, the,

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:03.460
there is definitely this tension towards, you know, learning theory, hardcore theory

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:07.260
and becoming always more and more knowledgeable about that.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.260
Right.

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.340
And in that way, you detach yourself from applications.

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:15.420
I think you're right that I think in some ways, some of the incentives in academia just

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.420
aren't right.

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.740
That, you know, the incentive is to write an eight page paper that is completely impenetrable,

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:26.540
that no one understands and so on, and, you know, is poorly written, which is actually,

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:32.060
it's obfuscated, maybe not intentionally, but so I think a lot of the incentives are

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.940
towards that, but I think that's the wrong incentive.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:41.180
So I would, my advice would be to do something your advisor sometimes will not be on board

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180
with.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.280
And, and that is, you know, poke around, look at other things, right?

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.600
Take the time to write things that are clear and simple, make some open source implementations

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.880
of various things and just literally just contribute it to the world.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.960
That'd be one of my pieces of advice.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.720
The other thing is just hang out and talk to other people in other fields and try to

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.360
hold back on judgment until you've begun to understand their dialect.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.560
I wish someone had given me that advice.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.400
I think this is great advice.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.220
Well, Steven, thanks a lot for your time.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.040
It's been a wonderful journey to chat with you.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.760
Thanks for accepting our invitation.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.400
Oh, thank you so much, Alberto.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.320
I think this is a great idea and I hope it's going to do a lot of good.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.320
It's awesome.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320
