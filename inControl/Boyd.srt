00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:23,240
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,200
Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Center of Competency Research on Dependable Ubiquitous

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,620
Automation and the International Federation of Automatic Control.

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,140
Our guest today is Stephen Boyd, Samsung Professor in the School of Engineering, Department of

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,260
Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,840
Welcome to the show, Stephen.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Thanks Alberto.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm very happy to be here.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,060
Well, Stephen, there's a million different ways that I could start this episode.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,920
You are one of the most well-known researchers in our field.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,000
You're ranked among the top 10 researchers in research.com in the engineering and technology

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,840
scientists ranking.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,400
And according to Wikipedia, you are well-known for convex optimization.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,080
But I wonder whether you still identify as a control theorist.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
That's a good question.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,200
Actually, I do.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,380
Control was maybe not quite my first field, but it's essentially the field that I grew

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,400
up in intellectually.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,720
So I absolutely identify as someone in control.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,200
I do sometimes cringe at the theorist part of it, brings back bad memories and things

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
like that.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,440
But control, absolutely, I do identify as a control person.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
Yeah.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,920
Because your first degree was in mathematics.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
That's right.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
From Harvard University.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Is that right?

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
That's right.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
My undergraduate degree was in pure math.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,000
And I even went off to Berkeley for a PhD.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,400
I entered in pure math, but within a year I had transferred to EECS.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
So I'm curious.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,360
What had drawn you to control?

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,640
You know, actually, I'd like to say that I thought about these things very carefully

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
and looked at different fields and, you know, made a table of the pluses and minuses.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,840
And that's a complete lie.

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,000
I did no such thing.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,400
It was just completely accidental.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,920
I had been in pure math, but I was getting an inkling that I wanted to do something more

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,360
applied.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,560
And I went over to take some classes in EECS at Berkeley.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,280
I took classes from people like, you know, Eugene Wong, Pravin Varaya, Charlie DeSore.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Now I thought this was just a random sampling of classes.

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,120
Of course, it wasn't.

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,160
These are some of the most mathematical and brilliant people in, you know, the whole area.

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,400
And I thought like, wow, this is awesome.

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,280
So I transferred to EECS in my second year of my PhD program.

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Yeah.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,200
And I think I was also reading on perhaps the Control Systems magazine, you were touring.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
That's true.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,920
And you were involved in a rock and roll band.

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm not sure how does that blend with, you know.

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Not a band.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,400
So actually this, it does kind of explain, you know, my background, which is very weird,

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I think.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Yeah.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,160
Is that related to your passion to EECS?

60
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
It is.

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,200
You know, when I was like, let's say in high school, I did two things.

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Pure math.

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
So I was into pure math very, very young.

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,440
I did pure math.

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,240
But I also did a very super applied electrical engineering, right?

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,480
So I worked as a stagehand at a large theater in Berkeley, and they had rock and roll shows

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
come in every weekend or something like that.

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,800
And maybe one result of that was, you know, by the time I graduated from high school,

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,160
I actually, I knew quite well how rock and roll shows work.

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,680
I knew exactly what everything did.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,160
I knew, I even started recognizing people who were touring with, you know, different

72
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,560
bands and things like that.

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,520
So anyway, I went off to Harvard as an undergrad.

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,280
I was in pure math.

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,320
By the way, at this point in my life, I was actually fairly clueless.

76
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,120
I didn't really know that, for example, EE and math were related.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Right.

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,840
I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous these days, but I don't know.

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,720
Well, I was just pretty clueless also, but it was also just a lot less information out

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
there.

81
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,040
But I guess in a way you were already familiar with the concept of amplifiers, feedback and

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
all those things.

83
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah, I certainly did.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
When I, you know, when I did electrical engineering, we certainly used math, but it wasn't sort

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,400
of like, you know, advanced or fancy kind of math.

86
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Yeah.

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,880
Anyway, so when I went off to Harvard, I remember I wrote a letter, which of course is like

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,920
completely hilarious these days, but I wrote a letter to the head of what was then the

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,720
second largest rock and roll sound company in the U.S. called Maryland Sound Industries,

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
MSI.

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,640
I mean, I'm sure everybody wants to do this, but it's probably so shocked to get a letter

92
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,400
from a kid at Harvard that he responded.

93
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,760
So I went out on a test thing, you know, test drive or whatever.

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,680
I went for like maybe two, three days with not a lot of sleep.

95
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,840
I had the great advantage that I knew their systems perfectly because they'd come, you

96
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,960
know, they had something like 14 tours every summer, two or three of them would come through

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
the theater where I worked and I actually knew their equipment.

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I knew how it worked.

99
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,680
It was actually quite innovative and cool to have like really kind of cool patch panels

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
and things.

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
So I knew how it worked.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,740
So I remember they told me, they said, go wire up the left side of the stage, but don't

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,700
even think about powering it up, you know, because if I wired it up wrong, everything

104
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
would blow up or something like that.

105
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,260
So I went over, I knew how the system where I fixed it all, I wired it all up, came back

106
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,220
and they said, what are you, an idiot?

107
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
What happened?

108
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
We said to go wire.

109
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
I said, it's done.

110
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,420
And they said, well, that's impossible.

111
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,740
No one could do it that fast.

112
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,580
And the guy comes over and looks at it and he starts like holding his head and he says

113
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,820
like, oh my God, he did.

114
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,580
So then what happened was then rumors started spreading of me being a rock and roll sound

115
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,340
wunderkind.

116
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
That's what happened.

117
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,020
And actually, and they got better and better.

118
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,780
I mean, you know, someone said, yeah, he set up the entire stage.

119
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,420
He did an entire set change in between acts in like 90 seconds flat.

120
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,860
You know, it just, all sorts of crazy stories grew.

121
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,100
Anyway, the result was that I was hired by that company.

122
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,900
And I told them, look, it's, this is all wrong.

123
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,440
I've seen your equipment.

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,540
That's how I know how to put it together.

125
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,940
And they were like, anyway, the stories kept growing, actually for years they kept growing.

126
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,260
I worked for that company maybe for about six years on and off.

127
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,100
So basically I was either in school or I was essentially on the road doing rock and roll

128
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
sound.

129
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,420
So I guess there was your first sliding door.

130
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,420
You could have actually made a career in that direction, but you decided to go to Berkeley

131
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,700
for a PhD in control theory.

132
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Exactly.

133
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,980
I remember very well when the owner of the sound company was like telling me like, dude,

134
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,940
I don't know about this PhD thing, but you should do this right now.

135
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,380
Actually, I thought, I mean, I thought about it, not too much actually, to tell you the

136
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
truth.

137
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,340
What was funny was I met him about 10 years ago.

138
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,540
So long, long time, many decades after I had stopped working for them.

139
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,580
And two things happened when we chatted.

140
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
It was funny.

141
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,660
Number one is I was thinking to myself, the stories I remember from that time, maybe I've

142
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
improved.

143
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
I probably, I did improve them.

144
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,300
I don't know if they're true or not.

145
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,980
I mean, they were probably based in truth, but anyway.

146
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,260
He confirmed that some of the stories that I was most suspicious of, these are my own

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
stories.

148
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,860
He confirmed they were true.

149
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,300
And then reminded me of even crazier stories that I had completely forgotten.

150
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,180
So anyway, so, so anyway, but somehow the appeal of Volterra series was more, you know,

151
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,060
when you put it that way, I think the answer is no.

152
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,060
I can tell you this.

153
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,740
If you're, if you're mixing house in a 15,000 seat venue, right.

154
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,940
And you know, on your headphones, the stage manager says, we're T minus four seconds.

155
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,300
And you pop your button across the, to unmute all the sub masters on the mixing console.

156
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,820
You know, this, this beats Volterra series.

157
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I'm just going to say it.

158
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
It's good.

160
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,820
No.

161
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,580
And anyway, I guess when you were in Berkeley, you were surrounded by people that nowadays

162
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,420
are considered giants in the field.

163
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm thinking of Chua, Dessour, Sastry, just to name a few.

164
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,900
And I was wondering, what was your experience there?

165
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,540
Oh, it was great.

166
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,580
I mean, they are the reason I switched over to EECS.

167
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,300
I mean, you know, they were, and in very different ways, you know, Dessour was precise and very

168
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,020
clear in a beautiful way.

169
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,500
Chua just knew so much.

170
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,580
It was just, you know, had an interest just all over the map and all sorts of weird areas

171
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,180
involving, you know, nonlinear circuits, but also all sorts of crazy stuff.

172
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,980
And then Sastry, Shankar Sastry was amazing.

173
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,700
He was this kind of young, I think I called him a child professor because he really was.

174
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,460
I mean, he was just a kid.

175
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,100
Had just an infinite amount of energy.

176
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,900
These three were just, you know, if you take the convex hull of these three, it's very

177
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
impressive.

178
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Let's put it that way.

179
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,900
So, yeah, they had a big influence on me.

180
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,820
And your investigations there were, as you mentioned, fairly theoretical.

181
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,420
I mean, yeah, you know, in doing my homework for this podcast, I was checking your first

182
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,980
paper with Leon Chua, I believe, on the passivity criterion for TIN ports.

183
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,620
And I actually love the abstract, it was incredible, because it already gives a bit of a hint about

184
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,340
your future style in a way, which is quite predictive.

185
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,700
You say there are existing proofs of the passivity criterion for linear time invariant

186
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,460
distributed ports are either incorrect or too involved, requiring the use of advanced

187
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
mathematics such as distribution theory.

188
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,940
This paper presents a simple but completely rigorous proof using only basic, real and

189
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,980
complex analysis.

190
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,260
I think that's wonderful already.

191
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
That's great.

192
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,900
Now, in my defense, I will say that that was at the very beginning of my transition from

193
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
math to ECS.

194
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,900
I guess a lot of people think about, you know, how is, what are the good parts about math

195
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,620
and why should you learn some and stuff like that.

196
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,140
One aesthetic in math is simplicity.

197
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,140
I mean, you know-

198
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,140
Occam's razor.

199
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,140
Yeah.

200
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
Some people make stuff really complicated.

201
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,780
And, you know, there's stories, possibly even true of, you know, Russian mathematicians

202
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,340
who spend seven years working on a paper and someone says, why?

203
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,380
And he said, the proof used to be seven pages.

204
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,780
Now it's three quarters of a page.

205
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,420
Now I'm happy with it, right?

206
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,300
And so, you know, so there is this very clean and lean aesthetic in math.

207
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,100
And I think it's, it's actually guided me.

208
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I'm very attracted to it.

209
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I won't say I'm not.

210
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Right.

211
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
It's, I think it's very cool.

212
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,460
You think that's the use of theory in practice or is there-

213
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,660
Oh, I think that's precisely the theory, right?

214
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,900
I think that's exactly the idea.

215
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,460
I think that, you know, I see a lot of people who imagine that theory is used in practice

216
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,460
like this, right?

217
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,220
Like I go grab a theorem from a journal and then I apply it or whatever, whatever that

218
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
means.

219
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
I don't even know what that means.

220
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,780
But the point is that's completely wrong, right?

221
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,420
I'm not aware of any theorem that's actually used in anything.

222
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,740
I mean, maybe in some kind of, you know, number theory or something, but it doesn't matter

223
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,020
for cryptography.

224
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,540
But other than that, I'm not aware of any.

225
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,740
So in my opinion, the real value of math in applied settings, control being one of them,

226
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,020
or at least one of them, is what it gives you is clarity of thought.

227
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,560
And that's extremely important in practice.

228
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,740
So let me explain that, right?

229
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,220
If I, you know, here we are in Silicon Valley and people build stuff and, you know, I could

230
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,940
get one team and say, you know, go build this thing.

231
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,700
And with a lot of high level tools now, you can bang something together that looks like

232
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
it's working.

233
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,380
I mean, there's kind of a UI and the app works and something happens, but there's another

234
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,180
style and I've seen other people do this.

235
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
It's just beautiful.

236
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,700
And there are people who think about it very deeply, often trained in things like math

237
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,200
or something abstract, and they don't do anything for a day or two, right?

238
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,260
After a day or two, they look up and they go, hey, you know what?

239
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,660
The 87 things that we've been asked to implement are actually all instances of only three different

240
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,660
things.

241
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,860
So we're going to implement that correctly.

242
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,840
And then, you know, blah, blah, blah, it'll all fit together.

243
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,620
So what happens is they'll build something.

244
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,700
And here's where this is practically useful.

245
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,460
You know, when people just hack something together to knock off 87 requirements, it's

246
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,560
going to be horrible code, badly structured, there's going to be all sorts of weird dependencies.

247
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
It won't be correct.

248
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,700
You'll never be able to actually debug it.

249
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,260
You definitely cannot extend it or anything like that or modify it.

250
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,660
Whereas when you see people who actually kind of think abstractly and actually took the

251
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,660
time to work out what were the correct abstractions, you get beautiful, lean code that has very

252
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,180
high probability being correct.

253
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,180
It's extensible.

254
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,420
And then just as a purely practical matter, the cost of ownership of that project is a

255
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
lot less.

256
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,180
Because, you know, it actually will, number one, it will work.

257
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,620
Number two, it's extensible.

258
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,700
It's maintainable.

259
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,420
It's like Linux, for example.

260
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,220
That's a good model of this.

261
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,740
Well, here, there's a lot to unpack already.

262
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,420
I think implicitly, you're touching also on the concept of maybe something that we're

263
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,580
going to talk about, the concept of disciplined convex programming, but also generally the

264
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,820
idea that maybe this is actually the value of human creativity in a way that of parsing

265
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,140
through different concepts and being able to synthesize in a way what is important and

266
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,740
how to categorize different ideas or I guess classes in the language of computer science.

267
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm not sure.

268
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,300
But yeah, maybe taking a step back.

269
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,900
I feel like we're diverging from your PhD at Berkeley.

270
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,780
I just wanted to understand how that actually relates to you today in a way.

271
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,860
So how do we connect a person that, you know, had this crazy interest for mathematics, full

272
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,260
time operators, very, very theoretical concepts with the person that you are today?

273
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:54,060
So something that I would associate you to very applied concepts, very useful in a way

274
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,220
concepts for everyday engineering.

275
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,060
Yeah, it does apply.

276
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,260
As I said, that was sort of the beginning of my transition from pure math to EECS in

277
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,420
general to more practical things.

278
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,260
You can call it applied math.

279
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,380
Control was one interest.

280
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,020
So I think that was the very beginnings of it.

281
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,300
Actually, it's since then, I mean, I'm still on that journey.

282
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:24,260
And it's super interesting to me to see how people in different fields use math.

283
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,140
And you know, by this time in my life, I've visited many, many fields.

284
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,780
So I've been a sort of a visitor at many.

285
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,700
But I've actually spent time, you know, spent like, you know, whatever, you know, a couple

286
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,100
of year periods in a bunch of fields.

287
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,900
I mean, circuit design was one, that was very weird.

288
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,740
Finance is another.

289
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,700
And what's interesting to me are the anthropological issues.

290
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,980
How do people use math in practical settings?

291
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,380
So it's really questions like, you know, how do they think about this?

292
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,860
Do they use a lot of brute force computing?

293
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,900
It's so interesting.

294
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,580
And what's very interesting to me is I found out that in these different fields, which

295
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,700
are, you know, speak completely different dialects.

296
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,180
I mean, they're not completely mutually unintelligible, I can guarantee it.

297
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,460
What's interesting when you look at that is the same topics come up over and over again.

298
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,940
You know, one would be, you know, how good is your model?

299
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,660
And the acknowledgement that your model is not perfect, right?

300
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,780
You know, in let's say circuit design, you know, spice model for a process that's already

301
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,380
pretty mature, that's actually pretty good.

302
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,580
In finance, you know, the models are, or as a friend of mine says, he's super happy if

303
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,420
he gets the sign right, right?

304
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,820
So, you know, this is not Newtonian mechanics, right?

305
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,060
But then, you know, robustness is another one.

306
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,700
Like, you know, how do you design something or decide on good actions or build a good

307
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,620
model that's going to be robust to things being not what you thought they were?

308
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,020
And that comes up in every single field.

309
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,540
They all have interesting different ways to talk about it and think about it.

310
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,900
And some of the methods that are used are from one field or other might look very unsophisticated,

311
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,620
but in fact work very well.

312
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,540
So that's sort of very interesting to me to see how people do this.

313
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,800
I guess that's really the value in a way of traveling, at least from an intellectual perspective.

314
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,620
There is this quote from Mark Twain.

315
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,540
He says, travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow mindedness.

316
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,860
And it seems like this very well resonates with what you just said.

317
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah.

318
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,740
So, you know, whether traveling intellectually taught you something that you didn't know before.

319
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Absolutely.

320
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,580
I strongly recommend it to everyone.

321
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,060
Just to know a little bit about different fields.

322
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,260
One of the interesting things is that you really get people speaking different dialects

323
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,740
and you can't.

324
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,920
They are mutually unintelligible unless someone is there who actually speaks both dialects.

325
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,380
It's very hard to translate from one to the other.

326
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,940
And now I know when I go into a field and I listen and I'm like, these people sound

327
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,820
like idiots to me.

328
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,060
But now I know from experience that I should just calm down, you know, wait a couple of months.

329
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Maybe some of these terms are going to start and then I'll start understanding what they're saying.

330
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,380
And in fact, they're not idiots.

331
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,740
And this has happened to me many, many times.

332
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,460
And it's so it's actually quite interesting.

333
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,100
I think it's very good for all of academia and for research.

334
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,300
It's super good to travel, to look at other areas.

335
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:36,420
I guess your first travel was from control itself towards the world, I guess, of computation.

336
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,820
Would it be fair to say?

337
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Yeah.

338
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,500
Actually, I think the very first academic stuff I did was on modeling of nonlinear systems

339
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,820
via Volterra series.

340
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,420
I also dabbled in, at that time, adaptive control.

341
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,620
And then actually became interested in designing control systems using numerical optimization

342
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
methods.

343
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Right.

344
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
So that's one thing I did.

345
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,100
I think that's the branch that grew into what I ended up really focusing on.

346
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,420
And, you know, what I liked about that stuff, I mean, that was a long time ago, what was

347
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:14,540
very interesting about it was that it appealed to me aesthetically because it was both theoretical,

348
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,380
it was using all sorts of stuff about, you know, the parametrization of stabilizing controllers.

349
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,980
It was using kind of theoretical stuff.

350
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,740
It also used computation to actually solve problems.

351
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,580
And then at the same time, it was actually extremely useful, right?

352
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,700
It actually solved real problems.

353
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,420
So I think that combination of things just really appealed to me.

354
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,500
And I mean, it still does, to be honest.

355
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,980
So I think it's great.

356
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Yeah.

357
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,420
In fact, I mean, what I saw, you know, doing a bit of searching was that you got your PhD

358
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,260
in 1985.

359
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,060
And from 1988, what I observed is that the word computation starts to appear in your

360
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,980
publications and it grows from 1988 to 1992.

361
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,340
It goes like one, one, and then three, four per year.

362
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,420
So it definitely seems to resonate with you.

363
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,940
And at the same time, also the keyword optimization as well.

364
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,740
So you were moving definitely in that direction from the world of nonlinear systems and very

365
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,060
complicated mathematical tools, I would say.

366
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Yeah.

367
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,180
And I very much like the idea that sort of, you know, some advanced mathematical things

368
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,980
like convex optimization, actually they are very mathematical, but they're also unbelievably

369
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,460
useful, which is super interesting because, you know, you normally think of this weird

370
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,700
axis where, you know, on one side, there's like pure theory and it's pretty useless,

371
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
right?

372
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,980
And then on the other side, you have something that's, you know, there's almost no theory

373
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
and it's super useful.

374
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,380
And of course, you do see some of that.

375
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,380
But what's interesting is that there are a lot of things that are both and I find that

376
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,540
sort of very interesting.

377
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,700
I think it's very cool.

378
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,860
I definitely wanted to talk about this topic.

379
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,100
Both of your most well-known publications or books rather, Linear Metrics Inequalities

380
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:09,220
in Systems and Control Theory and Convex Optimization are masterpieces in this domain.

381
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,240
And they both involve quite a bit of convex optimization and they do turn into something

382
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,840
that is incredibly useful and that's perhaps also reflected in the success, at least in

383
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,160
terms of citations, if we take that as a measure.

384
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,220
And I'm wondering, I mean, one question I would have for you is why should everybody

385
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,320
know a bit of convex optimization?

386
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
That's a good question.

387
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Yeah.

388
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,160
Of course, it does depend on our definition of everybody because if you really mean just

389
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,680
everybody, then I'm not sure I'd be on board with that statement.

390
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,040
So if you mean anyone who does any kind of quantitative work, then I would totally agree

391
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,600
with the statement.

392
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,640
And yeah, I can say a little bit about why I think it is important for anyone who...

393
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,760
And that's many, many fields, right?

394
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,600
And there's the obvious ones like whatever, all of engineering, right?

395
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,680
Much of social science these days.

396
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,160
So maybe quite a lot of science.

397
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,400
So the reason is it's an incredibly important tool to actually solve optimization problems,

398
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
right?

399
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,520
That the usual sort of story on optimization problems is here's what I'd like to solve.

400
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,280
And then basically, I mean, people don't admit it when they're teaching these classes, but

401
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,560
the bottom line is we can't actually solve most of those problems, right?

402
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,120
You just can't, right?

403
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
I mean, maybe that doesn't matter.

404
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,000
We have heuristics that do well and if you get a good model or if you make good

405
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,640
predictions or if your hedge fund makes money, you're fine.

406
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,000
You don't need to worry about that.

407
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,240
But the fact is there is a group of mathematical optimization problems that we can solve numerically

408
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,600
via computers really, really well.

409
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,720
I mean, I used to go around and say things like, oh, the great advantage is you get the

410
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,920
global optimum.

411
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,240
There's no apologies.

412
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,600
You don't have a little star and a footnote and the footnote when you say, oh, I minimize

413
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,760
this and the footnote says, well, maybe or maybe I didn't or something like that, right?

414
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,280
So I used to do that until actually I remember I met someone who was a senior executive at

415
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,800
a large semiconductor firm.

416
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,840
So I was chatting with him and I said, look, this is the best design of this thing that

417
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
there is.

418
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,480
And he looked at me and said, how could you possibly know that?

419
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
How could you know?

420
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,040
And I realized like for a normal person, that's the correct response.

421
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,920
Like what hubris, right?

422
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,120
What would cause a person to say this is the best there is, right?

423
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,240
And I said, I started my usual spiel, which was like, hey, look, you know, basically,

424
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,040
you know, it has to do with the mathematical properties of the functions involved and I'm

425
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,160
blabbering on and on.

426
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,640
And he just puts his hand up and says, stop, stop right there.

427
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
And I was like, what is it?

428
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,200
And he said, look, fine, he said, but that's only the best design for this particular circuit

429
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
configuration.

430
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,400
And I was like, yeah, you're right.

431
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,880
And he said, but there's lots of others.

432
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
How do you know there's not another one?

433
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,080
And I said, you're right.

434
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,880
And then he said, now you be quiet and I'm going to tell you what's useful about convex

435
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
optimization.

436
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,440
So here I am being lectured by a senior circuit designer.

437
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,920
By the way, so, and he says to me, look, I don't care about your global stuff.

438
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Who cares?

439
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
If you do real engineering, nothing is global.

440
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,280
And I didn't even know what that means.

441
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
And I said, okay, granted.

442
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,120
And then he says, look, here's what's useful.

443
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,480
When you solve these things, you don't need a starting point, number one.

444
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,040
Number two, you don't need to babysit the algorithm.

445
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,720
And he said, we've looked at a lot of these algorithms that do circuit design and stuff

446
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,800
like that.

447
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,640
They require a starting point, right?

448
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,520
He said, then they take off and they'll go from a good design to a quite good design.

449
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,600
And he said, do you know what we call a good design around here?

450
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I'm like, no, what?

451
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
And he said, done, done.

452
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,840
He said, we are under unbelievable business pressure to get things out there.

453
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,280
And I said, well, since you have a good design, like we don't want to get another 15% of performance

454
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
out of it.

455
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
We want to tape it out.

456
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,280
So I listened and I realized like, oh my God, like he's totally right.

457
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,880
And what's interesting is how it, where it goes in control.

458
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,200
So in control, you know, if you embed a convex optimization solver in a control system, as

459
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,960
you might do an MPC or for actuator allocation, it's not a question.

460
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,520
It's not like the fact that you're getting global optimal, who cares?

461
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,560
What matters is these algorithms can be made so reliable that they can be embedded in systems

462
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,960
with absolutely no oversight that solve things a thousand times a second in safety, critical

463
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
things.

464
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,400
And they just don't fail.

465
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,640
That's actually the real value I would say, right?

466
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Of this.

467
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,560
So, so anyway, I think there are a lot of practical values.

468
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,200
They're not the obvious ones that maybe I thought when I was young, let's put it that

469
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
way.

470
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah.

471
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,280
And I find very interesting the fact that you really interfaced with the industrial

472
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,440
world and really hardcore levels.

473
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,240
I was reading that your CVX gen, which I'm sure we're going to talk about later, has

474
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,640
been used in SpaceX missions recently.

475
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,840
And I was wondering what was your experience there?

476
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
Like thinking about the cultural difference, if you want, between the world of academia

477
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,760
in which you presumably live, but also the other world, the real world in a sense.

478
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah.

479
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
So that's interesting.

480
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Actually, it wasn't used recently.

481
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,440
Every single one from the prototypes through, it's just in production now.

482
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Yeah.

483
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,320
So, and to be completely clear about that, how much I had to do with it was very, very

484
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
little.

485
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,360
It was my student, Thomas Lipp and Lars Blackmore, who were the ones who really pioneered these

486
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
things.

487
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:43,000
It's wonderful to see these things realized in very sophisticated settings and also to

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,520
deliver incredible value.

489
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,000
You know, classical control and things like that just wasn't going to cut it for this,

490
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
So that was very gratifying.

491
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,880
I mean, there's been a lot of others, you know, in areas like finance and control and

492
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,960
energy management that it's very nice just to see people using this stuff.

493
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,000
I mean, I remember once I went to Tesla and some people who ran their grid scale storage

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
products.

495
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
It's very cool, right?

496
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,040
They have a giant cargo container full of batteries.

497
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,280
They have a Raspberry Pi and on it is running CVX Pi.

498
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Wow.

499
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,880
And they told me, actually, it's very funny.

500
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
They told me their problem.

501
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I listened.

502
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,320
It wasn't quite convex, but there's a street fighting trick, you know?

503
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,720
So I'm sitting there and they finish and I said, well, how do you solve it?

504
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,560
Expecting that I'm going to have to tell them this trick.

505
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,920
They proceed to then tell me precisely the trick and articulate it perfectly.

506
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,320
And I'm like, whoa, how did you guys figure that out?

507
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
And then they looked at each other.

508
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,120
They looked at me and they said, we took your class.

509
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,080
So I was like, okay, good, good.

510
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,600
So I was quite proud of that.

511
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,280
And actually it's one of those things where I said, well, so you don't need me.

512
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
That's great.

513
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
This is awesome.

514
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
And thanks for showing me this.

515
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,720
So I was very gratified that it happened.

516
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,600
Maybe talking about convex optimization and your classes and that, I mean, I'm sure also

517
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,400
we're going to talk about teaching later because you're the author of a legendary series on

518
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,880
convex optimization on YouTube and that is free access.

519
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,640
And there's definitely a lot to talk about there as well.

520
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,440
But I was trying to trace back a history of convex optimization somehow.

521
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,560
And of course the concepts of convexity go all the way back to, you know, Euclid, Archimedes

522
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,280
and optimization.

523
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,560
We can trace it back to Fermat, Lagrange and blah, blah, blah.

524
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,800
But I was wondering whether the actual start of convex optimization should be pinpointed

525
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,680
to linear programming, simplex algorithm, Danzig.

526
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,080
And then it seems like a very recent theory.

527
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
I think that's right.

528
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,160
The theory of convexity was codified maybe around the turn of the last century, right?

529
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,600
So that's when you would get, you know, but of course it had been used before that.

530
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,240
I mean, we still see fields where people are using essentially convex optimization and

531
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,640
either don't know it or don't point it out, right?

532
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,400
So you look at something, you go, oh, that's just a conjugate of that function, like, or

533
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
something like that.

534
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,680
And so the ideas were there, actually the inequalities were there.

535
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,760
It just got a common name, you know, around the turn of the last century.

536
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,520
Now, it was pretty much a theory then because computation was very limited.

537
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,320
But starting, you know, around mid 40s, I would say, is when things get interesting

538
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,400
and that coincides precisely with the development of the digital computer.

539
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,440
And you know, it wasn't long after, I mean, if you think about Danzig coming up with,

540
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,520
you know, a simplex method for linear programming, it was not that long after the development

541
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,760
of the first actual computers, right?

542
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,680
So, and I remember I actually overlapped with him at Stanford when I first came and I remember

543
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,960
him telling me something like that it was a huge big deal to solve like a linear program

544
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,840
with like 30 or 40 variables, which, you know, is laughable now, but he said that it was

545
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,720
a lot of effort and when they did it, they all like, you know, they went out and had

546
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
some beer to celebrate.

547
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,520
I mean, it was a big deal.

548
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,400
So it was one of the very first applications of digital computers.

549
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,080
But if I were going to say, you know, when does the, I mean, from a mathematical point

550
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,720
of view, you'd have to say, end of the 19th century, right?

551
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,840
But from the practical point of view, I think you'd have to say around 1950.

552
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
1950.

553
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Yeah.

554
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,880
And, and I guess then the developments were the, I mean, the most important ones were

555
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,680
the development of the interior point methods, I guess, ellipsoid method probably.

556
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah.

557
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Well, those are later.

558
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Yeah.

559
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
So you actually had two traditions.

560
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,000
It was actually very interesting in the West, in optimization, OR, and these kinds of areas.

561
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,200
The tradition was you'd either work on like linear programming or nonlinear programming,

562
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
right?

563
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
And that was the distinction.

564
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,960
I mean, it makes perfect sense.

565
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,080
I mean, it was fine, you know, and it's like linear programming was easy, interesting,

566
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,160
you know, nonlinear was more expressive, but, you know, it was complicated and maybe you

567
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,600
didn't even get the solution when you apply these algorithms to it.

568
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,760
And I think in the Soviet Union, however, there was a big focus, this is now in the

569
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,240
sixties, on actually convex optimization.

570
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,320
And so there was a lot of work done in the sixties and seventies and eighties in the

571
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Soviet Union.

572
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,200
I think we will talk about that later, where they really focused on convex optimization

573
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,680
and they came up with all sorts of things.

574
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,040
Interior point method was an interesting, super interesting method.

575
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,840
Of course, it's actually in practice, you know, pretty much not used and not useful.

576
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,080
And of course the converse of that is something like the simplex method, which in the sixties

577
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,520
was shown to be worst case exponential, but it didn't stop the hundreds of thousands of

578
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,680
people using it every day because it just worked unbelievably well in practice, right?

579
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,800
Interior point methods was also an interesting thing.

580
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,440
You know, that was a big, you know, rage in the late eighties and the nineties.

581
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,880
And I mean, it was crazy, but actually it turned out when people went back and looked

582
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,160
at the history, there were precursors of this.

583
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
I mean, this always happens.

584
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,000
And it turned out there was essentially a very clean interior point method that was

585
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,820
from the sixties by this guy Deakin.

586
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,480
And I remember corresponding with some of my friends who were then in Moscow at the

587
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
time.

588
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,880
And they said, they said something great.

589
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,240
They said, Deakin is hardly known in the Soviet Union and unheard of in the West.

590
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Right.

591
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
You know, you look at these things like they were pretty good.

592
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,260
They were like competitive with the algorithms that people in the West were writing and writing

593
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,120
papers on.

594
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,880
And they imagined that this was like revolutionary and, you know, nothing like this has ever

595
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
been done before.

596
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,120
And the answer was, you're wrong.

597
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,760
It was done in 1967, you know, in the Soviet Union.

598
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,920
The interplay between the Soviet Union and, you know, the Western world, both, you know,

599
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,400
mathematics, but also I would say in control are so interesting.

600
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,520
And I think there's a fantastic summary in your book on linear matrix inequalities about

601
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,480
the key events also in that domain specifically, not just in convex optimization.

602
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,680
And there you're actually right that it is fair to say that Yakubovich is the father

603
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,560
of the field of LMIs and Lyapunov the grandfather of the field.

604
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Yes.

605
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,280
And the new development at the stage where you write the book is the ability to directly

606
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,760
solve that's right.

607
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
General LMIs.

608
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,120
I thought that was a fantastic sentence, but it seems like Willems in his 1971 paper is

609
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,080
the one that actually points out there is a known appreciation that's right for LMIs

610
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
in control.

611
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
Yeah.

612
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
So that also has a very long history.

613
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,240
I mean, it goes to Lyapunov and it goes even into the 19th century and basically comes,

614
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,000
I think if you really traced it back to physics, to the concept of an invariant at first, right?

615
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,920
That's a quantity that doesn't change as the system evolves, right?

616
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,340
So, you know, if you have a closed system, it could be the total mass or the, you know,

617
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,360
or the total energy or the angular momentum about some axis or something, right?

618
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,840
And then it doesn't take much to generalize that to put an inequality there and to say,

619
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,760
how about a dissipated quantity?

620
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,120
That's a quantity that's always decreasing along trajectories of a very complex system.

621
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,760
And the whole point that was recognized even in the 19th century was that there were times

622
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,680
when you could identify something that was either an invariant or a dissipated quantity

623
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,640
without actually being able to solve for the trajectory, right?

624
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,720
So you could have a three, four body gravitational problem and say, at that point, you could

625
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,080
do this, I mean, numerically, which would be horrible because it'd be actual people,

626
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,080
you know, with, I guess, you know, hand calculators or something, but, you know, adding machines.

627
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,080
But what was interesting, it's super interesting, right, that you could actually, it was fully

628
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,520
appreciated then.

629
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,080
And of course, that comes up in control, right, where you'd say, I can't write down what the

630
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,320
trajectory of this is.

631
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,800
He says, but I'm about to prove to you that it's stable.

632
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,040
You know, in control, we don't even think about that because it's a part of control,

633
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
that idea.

634
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,480
But if you think about what that sounds like, I mean, if you really try to pretend you're

635
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,280
no longer 22 and a grad student learning this for the first time, you know, somehow the

636
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
wonder is lost.

637
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,680
Because you really should say, oh, my God, that's amazing, like, you can't tell me what

638
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,000
the solution of this differential equation, you're like, that's right, I have no idea

639
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
what's going to happen.

640
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,760
But I can guarantee you that the total energy is conserved or that the total energy is dissipated.

641
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
It's kind of cool, right?

642
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,380
I think you have to admit.

643
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
It's incredible.

644
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,480
And I wonder whether you think this is the most important concept?

645
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,920
I mean, how do you look back at the book on LMIs?

646
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,560
Yeah, I think that that's right.

647
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,760
I mean, that's the essential concept, which, you know, you can trace back to the 19th century,

648
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,760
you know, specifically for linear matrix inequalities, which basically looks at quadratic functions

649
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,000
that are these quantities that either decrease or invariant.

650
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,920
Usually in most interesting applications, they're dissipative, right?

651
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
They decrease.

652
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,800
And, you know, in the 40s, people had worked out, like, really cool ways to solve these

653
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,840
inequalities, right?

654
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Very simple ones, right?

655
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,840
And there were graphical methods, you'd literally get out some graph paper and draw some curve.

656
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,920
And, you know, if it stays away from some point in the complex plane, then anyway, that

657
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
was one.

658
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,320
There was a connection to control figured out with things like algebraic Riccati equations.

659
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,520
But I think the really interesting thing, and as you say, Willems and others, you know,

660
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,960
had already observed this, is that in the 70s, I think there were some papers in the

661
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,840
Soviet Union about directly solving to find one of these, you know, dissipated quantities

662
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:56,200
or a so-called Lyapunov function by numerical methods, which is, I think, you know, it's

663
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,320
not a huge thing, but it's pretty cool, right?

664
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,120
You know, up until that point, the way you've, I mean, look, let's think about the way people

665
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,040
find Lyapunov functions, right?

666
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,080
One is you start with physics and you say, well, let's just add the kinetic energy plus

667
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,200
a potential energy.

668
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,320
And that doesn't work, you add another term or two, and then voila, it worked.

669
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
You got something, right?

670
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,000
I mean, another method would be from optimal control.

671
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,240
So you'd actually, you'd write down an optimal control problem and you'd work out, let's

672
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,360
say, the value function of it.

673
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,480
So these were the traditional ways, right, through analytical methods and other stuff.

674
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Anyway, so it's really interesting, the idea that you can actually compute them.

675
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,920
And that's where I think convex optimization comes in, right?

676
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,680
It turns out that in a whole lot of cases, you can actually compute these Lyapunov functions

677
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,160
using convex optimization.

678
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
And I think that's super interesting.

679
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,960
By the way, I think it's under, you know, I look back at that book now and I'm a little

680
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
bit horrified.

681
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,800
I mean, I gave it to somebody the other day who was interested.

682
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I said, take a copy.

683
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,040
But I had to warn them.

684
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,920
I was like, look, you know, full disclosure, you know, it's really technical and it's weird

685
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
and all that.

686
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,640
And it predated the term semi-definite programming.

687
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,680
So we have some bizarre name for it, like the eigenvalue problem.

688
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,680
So I just said, look, just heads up, this is not a fun book.

689
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,160
But yeah, but I do think actually a lot of that stuff is super useful and actually hasn't

690
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,480
been fully explored.

691
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,240
So I'm actually wondering, do you think that is the last word on the topic or do you see

692
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,960
a future for what is the next step?

693
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,800
Honestly, I've been thinking about it on and off for a couple of years, but if I were going

694
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:44,920
to do something really weird, I might go back to that and build, you know, build some beautiful

695
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,040
software system for people to do that kind of stuff.

696
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,920
I mean, there were, of course, there were things in the past that did this.

697
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,560
There was this thing called LMI Lab or whatever, and there was a lot of other stuff driving

698
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
it.

699
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,920
But, you know, but just make it so that actually you could synthesize controllers and, you

700
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,160
know, performance certificates this way.

701
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,400
I mean, you, I think at one point you asked, you know, what were the essential ideas?

702
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
There's actually another very powerful idea that's in there.

703
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,480
And again, like many others, it can be traced way back.

704
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,920
But the idea, you know, in the eighties and nineties and aughts, people were thinking

705
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,640
a lot about, you know, verifying performance of something and the way we all know how this

706
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,040
actually works in the real world.

707
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,840
The way it works in the real world is someone designs a controller and they put some saturation

708
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,960
in and then they tweak this gain and they do that and they do this and they gain schedule

709
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,960
something and what they fiddle around and then they simulate it with a high fidelity

710
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,360
simulator on a lot of stuff.

711
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,440
And after a while they declare, I think it works.

712
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
There it is.

713
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Right.

714
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,520
And then they pass this controller over the wall to, you know, some control theorist who's,

715
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,040
you know, typically hiding in the back room, right back room, meaning they're in a place

716
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,880
where they should never come out in public.

717
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Right.

718
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,000
Which I, which I think is probably the correct way to handle most control theorists.

719
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Anyway.

720
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,560
So they throw the policy over the wall to this control theorist and they say, please

721
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,840
verify this, please validate it.

722
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Right.

723
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,320
And, you know, you, it's interesting, I mean, you can try and you can do all sorts of stuff

724
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,440
and you know, but it turns out, I think one thing you can conclude and one way to interpret

725
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,320
the entirety of all the LMI stuff is to say, that's the wrong way to do it.

726
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,760
You don't do it sequentially.

727
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,200
The right way to do it is to co-design the policy or controller and the certificate or

728
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
proof of correctness.

729
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
You co-design them.

730
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:38,560
And in fact, an even cooler and more advanced view, which I think people probably knew this

731
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,760
in the 60s or 70s, is you design the proof of correctness first and then the controller

732
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,280
will fall out from it.

733
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Right.

734
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,120
So if I produce a control Lyapunov function or an approximate, that's the idea behind

735
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,000
approximate dynamic programming.

736
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Right.

737
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,400
And incredibly powerful idea, I think.

738
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,200
And I guess this is very much related to some of your most recent work on COCP.

739
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,040
Is that fair to say?

740
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
It is fair to say.

741
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah.

742
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,960
So COCP is Convex Optimization Control Policy.

743
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,760
And it's a broad term for a policy in sequential decision making.

744
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,200
Could be a controller, but it could also be a trading engine.

745
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
It could be all sorts of other stuff.

746
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,720
It could be an alarm system.

747
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,680
So I'm thinking of control in a very broad way here.

748
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,880
And it basically embeds a convex optimization problem that you solve.

749
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
Right.

750
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,680
And, you know, I mean, there's lots of examples of this.

751
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,920
I mean, in traditional control, you'd have MPC, which has been done, I think, since the

752
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
late 70s.

753
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,920
MPC and like chemical process control.

754
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,720
And it's really fascinating, right, that you actually, you solve this complicated problem

755
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,000
and then that tells you your current action.

756
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,360
And then 15 minutes later, you do it again.

757
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
It's cool.

758
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,840
For the audience, I should probably just add what it perhaps is MPC just for everybody

759
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,080
to be on the same page.

760
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,560
So model predictive control, it's just, I guess the main idea there is really to solve

761
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,680
an optimal control problem recursively, iteratively, and that turns out to be a very good idea

762
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
in practice.

763
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Yeah.

764
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,280
This is the very, very short sales speech, I would say.

765
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Yeah.

766
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,240
But you were saying something about convex optimization policies.

767
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,720
I find that concept quite interesting and in a way also revolutionary.

768
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,560
I was watching a keynote that you gave at L4DC in 2022, and there was a fantastic, controversial

769
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,440
statement there that goes like, tuned COCP, so convex optimization control policies, is

770
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,080
the PID controller of the 21st century.

771
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Can you elaborate on this?

772
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
I can.

773
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:49,480
So this is one of the things that you come to appreciate in control, and it's a really

774
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,480
cool fact about our field, and I think we should accept it and embrace it.

775
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,520
I think it's really awesome.

776
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:02,440
It's this, is that incredibly simple sounding algorithms can be unbelievably effective in

777
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
practice.

778
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,680
You know, PID controller is one of them, right?

779
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,120
And it's very funny when you go to a fancy control thing and you'd be hearing a lot of

780
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,280
theory and some fancy new robust controller and stuff like that.

781
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,360
It's just kind of, it's good grounding to think every now and then about things like

782
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,820
PID controller, lead lag control.

783
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,620
So I thought your definition of MPC was very good.

784
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:33,460
I want to put it in maybe a less fancy way to say it, because I see it, actually, it's

785
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,220
used in many, many fields with different names, right?

786
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,940
So the way, at the highest level, I would say it goes like this, right?

787
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,340
You know, you want to take an action.

788
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,780
It's for sequential decision making.

789
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,100
So you know, you can act right now, and there's stuff that you know, and there's stuff you

790
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,100
don't know.

791
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,140
Like you don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future.

792
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,300
You probably have some idea, but you don't know exactly.

793
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
And so the first thing you do is you get a forecast.

794
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
And it's ridiculous.

795
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,820
It's a single forecast of what's going to happen in the future, right?

796
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:07,020
You say, this is the way I think energy prices and demand are going to be moving in the next

797
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,020
48 hours.

798
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,180
Like that's a prediction.

799
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,780
And someone says, wow, do you believe it?

800
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,780
And you're like, no, of course not.

801
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
It's just a forecast.

802
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,580
I mean, come on, right?

803
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,460
Okay, then you do this.

804
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,660
It sounds so naive.

805
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,660
It's unbelievable.

806
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,660
You then do the following.

807
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,660
You say, okay, well, guess what?

808
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,540
I'm going to create myself a plan of action, assuming my single forecast is completely

809
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,540
correct.

810
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,340
And you're like, that makes no sense.

811
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,220
It doesn't make, it's like, this is not going to work, right?

812
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,220
Okay.

813
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,300
And then you say, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a plan of action.

814
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,100
You take the first step in that plan of action.

815
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,100
And that's what I'm going to do today, or for this 15 minute period.

816
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,420
Then they say, well, what happens next 15?

817
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
Well, you see, I do the same thing.

818
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,060
I get updated forecasts, I replan.

819
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,220
And then, of course, there's a lot of theory around it, which is, frankly, a little bit

820
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,220
silly.

821
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,460
I mean, it is nice to know that it kind of works in some silly cases, right?

822
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:02,020
But I think the most important fact about it is something like PI and PID, when it's

823
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,580
done correctly, it works extremely well, thank you.

824
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,900
If you think about it, I mean, it's hilarious.

825
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,660
It's used in finance, where it's called multi-period trading or something, right?

826
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,860
And that's hilarious, because the entire point about finance is precisely that you do not

827
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,860
know the future.

828
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,420
You know, if I knew future returns, like, I mean, I don't know, I have friends who say

829
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,620
if you can get the sign right 52% of the time, you can make money, right?

830
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,380
So the point is, you very much don't know the future.

831
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,660
And yet, you know, in the right hands, there it is working in finance.

832
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,260
So I remember I talked to someone in supply chain.

833
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,260
This is how they do it.

834
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,260
This is what supply chain does.

835
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,900
I mean, of course it is, right?

836
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,860
You make forecasts of product demands, right?

837
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,500
And then you figure out, like, what stuff should you ship where and, you know, all that

838
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
kind of stuff.

839
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,660
And you're taking into account a lot of cool stuff, like, you know, the cost of trucking

840
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,100
things or transporting things from one place to another, the capacity in a warehouse, the

841
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,660
amount of labor you have available to do X, Y, or Z.

842
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,220
So it's, you know, very sophisticated.

843
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,700
But it's based entirely on forecasts, you know, a week, a month, or, you know, even

844
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,020
sometimes an hour out.

845
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,020
It does seem to be the most intuitive thing to do, actually.

846
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,020
It is.

847
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,940
And I remember I talked to someone who's an expert on supply chain stuff.

848
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,500
And I said, what do you call it when you make a forecast, then make a plan of action, pretending

849
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,180
that your forecast is correct, take the first step, and then repeat the whole thing one

850
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,820
time step later?

851
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,700
I said, you know, we, I said, we call, you know, I said, in my field, we call this, you

852
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,940
know, model predictive control, dynamic matrix control, you know, all, you know, receding

853
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
horizon control.

854
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,580
I said, we have lots of names for it.

855
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,580
What do you call it?

856
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,820
And he just looked, stared straight at me.

857
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,700
And he said, yeah, I said, like, what in supply chain?

858
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,700
I don't know that dialect.

859
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
What do you call it?

860
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,940
And he just looked at me and he said, we call that supply chain optimization.

861
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,300
The point, the point being, like, what else would you do, right?

862
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,980
Like, what else could you possibly?

863
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,980
So it was cool.

864
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,900
I also had a, had a hilarious conversation with a friend of mine who is a CFO of a company.

865
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,860
So we're just chit-chatting, you know, about what CFOs do.

866
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,860
And guess what they do?

867
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,980
He said, basically, by the time we finished talking, he said, that's 80% of my job.

868
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,980
That's what I do.

869
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,260
It's just, he said, he said, now I know the name for it.

870
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,260
It's MPC.

871
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,260
Yeah.

872
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,260
He said, look, here's what I do.

873
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,740
I get, I get multiple forecasts of, you know, demand for our product, costs, right?

874
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,260
I know we're opening a new facility in Austin next year, and that's going to cost X.

875
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,660
We forecast, you know, revenue, we forecast growth, you know, all sorts of stuff, like

876
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,180
many quarters out, like six, eight quarters out, right?

877
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,180
And he said, yeah, we don't believe those.

878
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,580
He said, in fact, we typically make three forecasts, right?

879
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:50,340
Kind of a median one, kind of a poor outcome, like, you know, low revenue and high expenses,

880
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,340
right?

881
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:57,300
And then, you know, when they sometimes label bliss, which is like a, you know, and yeah.

882
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,740
And then he said, we make a complete plan.

883
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,060
I present it to the board.

884
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,660
That's what we do.

885
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:09,580
And no one on the board believes that your revenue forecast four quarters out is going

886
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,580
to be right.

887
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,820
No one believes that.

888
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,820
No one.

889
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:18,400
So, but the cool part is everyone understands you do this plan, so you don't do something

890
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,120
now that's going to put you in a bad position in the future.

891
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,140
And that's really the essential idea.

892
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,140
That's crazy.

893
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,620
And it seems to apply to at any scale in a way, also like at a political scale, for example.

894
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,740
It does.

895
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,580
In many other domains.

896
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,020
But maybe just to go back to convex optimization control policies.

897
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:44,440
How do those relate to, let's say, MPC that we just discussed extensively and other things

898
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,740
that we mentioned before?

899
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:51,420
MPC, model predictive control, is simply an instance of a convex optimization control

900
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
policy.

901
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,060
It's a policy where you solve a problem to decide an action.

902
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,220
And in this case, you solve it over horizon.

903
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,220
There are a lot of others.

904
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:06,460
I mean, one is approximate dynamic programming is another classic example of that.

905
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,380
But there are lots of other things where, a lot of these things have parameters in them

906
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,060
that you can use to tune, right?

907
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,980
This is not at all unlike PID, where you have three parameters to tune.

908
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,020
You have a lot more than three parameters to tune in these things.

909
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,860
Actually, that's not true.

910
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,980
In some cases, you would have hyperparameters, and there might only be a few, right?

911
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:32,780
Like if you're doing finance, you might have a term hyperparameter that scales the risk

912
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:39,460
cost, or another hyperparameter that scales the transaction cost, right?

913
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:45,820
And as senior people in control told me decades ago, the right way to think of these parameters,

914
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,020
they were of course referring to like LQG, is they said, these are knobs that you turn

915
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,980
to make the controller do what you like.

916
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,660
And it's this identical principle here, right?

917
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,820
So people have made convex optimization control policies for a while.

918
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,700
It's growing, I think, or it appears to be.

919
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,260
Part of it is the relentless improvement in computers, right?

920
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,340
So that doesn't hurt us at all, I should say, right?

921
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
Everything's based on that.

922
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,340
But a lot of the tuning was done by hand.

923
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,940
And that's actually, if you've got three hyperparameters, why not, right?

924
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:28,340
What's interesting is even something like 10 or 20 or 30 hyperparameters is a case where

925
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,140
you can tune that policy to make it do what you want.

926
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,020
And so I think that's what a tuned COCP policy is.

927
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,220
And what's, I think, kind of exciting is not theoretical, because everyone knows about

928
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,820
all this and knows that this is the general program.

929
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:51,300
I think the most exciting part about it actually is the infrastructure and ecosystem being

930
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,700
built out to actually do this, right?

931
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,820
So we'll talk about that, I imagine.

932
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,820
We'll talk about CVXPi.

933
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,820
Definitely.

934
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,820
Definitely.

935
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,820
But to me, that's the most interesting part.

936
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,460
I mean, I'm just wondering, I'm going to put myself in the shoes of the audience.

937
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:12,900
And could we conceptualize COCPs as essentially parametric convex optimization programs in

938
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,340
the parameter being the control policy in a way?

939
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,740
Would that be fair to say?

940
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,300
Maybe not quite.

941
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,380
So there are two types of parameters in a convex optimization control policy.

942
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,700
One, it tells you the context, and that's typically like the state or the inputs.

943
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,140
Or if someone says, no, I changed my mind, here's your target over here, right?

944
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,620
That's one.

945
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,740
And the second are parameters that affect the policy.

946
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,020
Which you don't expect to change very often.

947
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,260
And as a matter of fact, in...

948
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,100
This would be the Qs and Rs, for example, in LQR.

949
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
You got it.

950
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,100
Exactly.

951
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,260
And to be honest with you, in most legitimate applications, you don't change those at all.

952
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,580
I mean, you know, whatever, except with a software update or whatever it is you want

953
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,860
to do, right?

954
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,860
That's the safe model.

955
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,860
So...

956
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,860
It sounds super interesting.

957
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:09,260
And I guess the ecosystem that you were referring to before has to do with the enormous amount

958
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,700
of software that you have produced, again, in your, I wouldn't even say double life,

959
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,500
but triple life or fourth life.

960
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,500
So your first endeavor in that direction, I guess, was CVX in 2008.

961
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
That's right.

962
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:29,020
But then it sparked into a whole, as you said, ecosystem of different types of frameworks.

963
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:36,660
So for example, CVX-Gen, CVX-Pi, you also have a Julia version as well, CVX-R, OSQP.

964
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,420
I'm pretty sure I didn't mention even half of them.

965
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
Is that right?

966
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,420
You're right.

967
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,420
You didn't.

968
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,420
It's okay, though.

969
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,420
It's fine.

970
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,420
I'm curious there.

971
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:51,780
I mean, I guess this is also the result of your interest in how to apply all the theoretical

972
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,700
concepts that you developed.

973
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:00,340
But also, the concept that I found most interesting there was the idea of disciplined programming,

974
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
convex programming.

975
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
Right.

976
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,860
Can you elaborate on what that concept means for our audience?

977
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,860
Oh, I can.

978
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,020
So, you know, I was going around being a pain in the ass to people about convex optimization,

979
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,620
both before the development of these tools and after.

980
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,380
And it would go like this.

981
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,820
I'd be all, I mean, I think about it now, it'd be awful.

982
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,900
Like I'd go somewhere and someone would say like, okay, here's my problem and I want to

983
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,340
do X, Y, and Z.

984
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,340
And I'd come up to them afterwards.

985
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,620
I'd say, hey, guess what?

986
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,620
Your problem's convex optimization problem.

987
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,620
And they'd say, so?

988
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,500
And I'd say, so it means we can solve it.

989
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,440
And they'd say, so how do I do that?

990
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,920
And the truth was, in those days, it's kind of a pain in the ass, right?

991
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,920
Because you have to, you know, write all, I said, well, you just get yourself a grad

992
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,680
student and, you know, have them write up all this horrible code and it's hard to debug

993
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,300
and translate it to some standard form.

994
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,480
Then you link it to some solver, whatever at the time, you know.

995
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,680
So it just wasn't that easy.

996
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,680
And I remember a lot of times, even when I had come up to someone and said, look, we

997
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,520
could just solve your problem.

998
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,520
A lot of those people just thought I was a crazy person, but that's another story.

999
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,240
But even the ones who said, yeah, I think you're right, it just, the barrier to entry

1000
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,280
was just too high.

1001
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,640
It just involved, you know, tons of coding and C and C++ to link something and all that

1002
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,160
sort of stuff.

1003
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,400
So the, you know, the idea behind discipline convex programming is, the short description

1004
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
is this.

1005
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,480
It is a system for basically normal people or relatively normal people to be able to

1006
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,560
specify and then solve a wide, very wide variety of convex optimization problems.

1007
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
Right?

1008
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,600
So the contract is very simple.

1009
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,160
It's this.

1010
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:50,880
You the user will accept basically extreme, extreme limitations on what you can express.

1011
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,200
Okay?

1012
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,520
Here's what we pay you if you honor that contract.

1013
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,800
Then what we will do is we will faithfully translate your problem to a standard form

1014
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,720
problem and solve it globally and give you the solution.

1015
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Right?

1016
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,720
That's the contract.

1017
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:11,640
And, you know, it's actually, I mean, it's not too dissimilar from the question of trying

1018
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,160
to verify a controller.

1019
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,880
You might imagine that the right way to use convex optimization in the field would be

1020
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,040
people just write their problem.

1021
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,040
And then, you know, some computer would look at it and try to argue and figure out if it's

1022
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,040
convex or not.

1023
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,480
And it turns out that's actually a truly terrible idea.

1024
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,040
The right way to do it is to say there's a very short language.

1025
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,840
As a matter of fact, there's exactly one rule, which is crazy.

1026
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
So there's just one rule.

1027
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,080
And if you follow, if you faithfully follow this one rule, when you form your problem,

1028
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,960
then we guarantee we can faithfully translate it and then it can be solved.

1029
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,680
And, you know, it's very different from so-called nonlinear optimization, right?

1030
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,080
Because in so-called nonlinear optimization, you can do anything you like.

1031
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,300
Type in whatever you like.

1032
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,320
But now then the solving it, the modeling is easy.

1033
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
And now the solving is like an art.

1034
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,240
And in fact, in most cases, you can't even do it.

1035
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,880
Anyway, so the idea of DCP is we just say, here's a simple rule.

1036
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,040
You follow this rule.

1037
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,240
We solve your problem.

1038
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,240
Period.

1039
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,640
And, you know, so we built a bunch of software implementations of this.

1040
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,000
And it's fun to watch it grow.

1041
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,400
And it's very widely used.

1042
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,800
It's kind of awesome.

1043
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,800
It's incredible.

1044
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,120
I myself was a user of many of these tools.

1045
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,320
And I can definitely vouch for the fact that it's incredibly easy to use.

1046
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,400
And that's perhaps where the success of these tools lies.

1047
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,320
So I was wondering, how do you actually make somehow these frameworks?

1048
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,880
I would imagine that it can be posed as programming language free, in a sense, because programming

1049
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,720
keeps on changing, in the sense of programming languages keep on changing, they keep on

1050
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,240
being updated.

1051
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,040
But how does one actually remains robust, let's say, to these changes?

1052
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,680
So, you know, what's interesting is this goes back to the stuff we talked about before,

1053
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,600
which was the value in practice of theory, right?

1054
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,060
That you could imagine just basically hacking something together that says, oh, if you see

1055
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,000
min or max, do this, right?

1056
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,320
If you see the square, the square root, do this transformation.

1057
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,480
And the point is, a system like that, it would probably never work.

1058
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,440
I mean, it might appear to work at some point, but it doesn't really.

1059
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,520
So DCP, Discipline Convex Programming, is built from an extremely small mathematical

1060
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,980
core, right?

1061
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,720
And the result is that with high probability, it's actually correct.

1062
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,280
Now what's interesting is implementing that core.

1063
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,920
And by the way, CVX was not the first one.

1064
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,400
I would say the first one was YALMIP, which was, you know, yet another LMI processor,

1065
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
which preceded it.

1066
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,200
It's very, very cool.

1067
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,160
Anyway, you know, the basic idea is very simple.

1068
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:57,000
When we first did this in like MATLAB, you know, quite a while ago, they had just barely

1069
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,120
introduced object oriented things, and it didn't really work and wasn't consistent and

1070
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,120
blah, blah, blah.

1071
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,600
And so it was actually kind of a pain to implement it.

1072
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,280
Of course, that was Michael Grant, who did that.

1073
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,980
You know, so what's happened is, as languages get more and more sophisticated, it gets easier

1074
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,240
and easier to solve.

1075
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,000
In Julia, for example, you know, which has the advantage of being a relatively recently

1076
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,560
developed language, the core of convex.jl, it's like 40, 50 lines.

1077
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,680
And you're like, how could that be?

1078
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,040
And the reason is that the language supports these very high level abstractions, right?

1079
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,080
So to me, that's actually really cool.

1080
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:43,040
The idea that, you know, you go back to like C and Fortran, and I don't know, you can do

1081
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,760
things like, you know, multiply two numbers, you know, and then shove them back into this

1082
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,120
memory location or something like that, right?

1083
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:56,760
I mean, but what's amazing is the new languages support incredible abstraction.

1084
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,320
That's awesome for people like us, who use math to do practical things, because it means

1085
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,080
you can actually express like really complicated things, or things that would be complicated

1086
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,600
in just a handful of lines of code.

1087
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,080
And I'm curious about like the future trends that you actually foresee.

1088
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,000
So for example, do you have any thoughts on the role of, say, AI in completing our own

1089
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,440
programs or what is the next big thing in solving the next type of most expressive optimization

1090
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
problem?

1091
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,440
I don't know.

1092
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,760
What are your thoughts on monitoring operators?

1093
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,240
There are so many questions that I still have, it's incredible.

1094
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:40,400
So first of all, things like, you know, a chat GPT is amazing, including the code generation

1095
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
portion of it.

1096
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,520
It's just, it's, it's actually amazing.

1097
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,280
It's awe inspiring.

1098
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:52,600
And it's super interesting, like, you know, we've played with it, and it's actually super,

1099
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,320
what it does is it generates things that sound completely correct, and usually are completely

1100
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,520
wrong.

1101
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,880
So which, but it's actually, to me, it was even a little bit disturbing, because I usually,

1102
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,360
you know, in looking at students work, I usually associate poor writing with being wrong, and

1103
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,880
good writing with being right.

1104
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,520
And here was very good writing, but the logic and math was just completely wrong.

1105
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,000
So now, by the way, I don't mean that as a criticism.

1106
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,800
It's just that, you know, when they were training this thing, and you know, that no one said

1107
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:30,280
that you should have a very negative reward for asserting something that's false, right?

1108
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,360
You know, so if it sticks to interpretations and things like that, it's great.

1109
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,880
And I, my suspicion is within a year or two, we'll see systems, you know, large language

1110
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:44,600
models that will actually do really well, and will generally speaking, not make false

1111
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,600
arguments.

1112
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,080
So I think it's just amazing.

1113
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:52,520
It is definitely interesting also to imagine different types of uses of these tools, for

1114
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,360
example, in other domains, like music, even.

1115
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,000
One can imagine that we could use them for a sculpture, for example, we feed them a bunch

1116
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,240
of images for 3D printers, and then they're going to create something totally new.

1117
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,560
Yeah, I'm very fascinated as well.

1118
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,580
And I'm curious, what's the role that you see there of optimization?

1119
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,680
Because it's definitely there under the hood.

1120
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,440
Well, certainly, it's entirely based on, you know, well, it's SGD, stochastic gradient

1121
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,480
descent under the hood on, you know, 100 billion parameter models.

1122
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,200
So but I know that's kind of a cheap thing.

1123
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,200
We all know that.

1124
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,080
We all know that that's how it works, right?

1125
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,600
And that's not why it works, although it's a critical component of it.

1126
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:35,900
So I think it'll be a very interesting, in a way, people were talking about, you know,

1127
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,480
we build things like CVXPi, so that you can in 10 lines, you know, you'd take a little

1128
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,720
bit of training and in 10 lines, you can describe and very sophisticated novel problems and

1129
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,200
have it solved, right?

1130
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:54,600
We have code generation tools, like CVXGen, or CVXPiGen, that's a newer version of CVXGen.

1131
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,200
And then you'd say, okay, I like what I'm seeing in simulation, please generate me real

1132
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,900
time code, I can dump onto my drone or whatever it is, right?

1133
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:08,420
So I think it's cool to have these high level tools that will simplify a lot of what used

1134
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,200
to be, you know, basically a lot of work.

1135
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,480
So people I've, I mean, actually, my students and colleagues were thinking like, this would

1136
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,480
be awesome.

1137
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,280
Like, you just talk to this thing and say, here's what it looks like.

1138
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,280
In fact, why don't you go fit a model to the dynamics?

1139
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,280
And it would do it.

1140
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,680
And then you'd say, okay, let's make a controller, show me some simulations with your controller.

1141
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,720
And you go, no, no, no, no, I don't like it, it's too rough a ride.

1142
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,960
And then it would, you know, add a term penalizing ride roughness, right?

1143
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,400
And so I can imagine like crazy stuff that would be really cool.

1144
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,880
And it would eventually just kick out, like real time code, you can run on your drone

1145
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
or whatever it is, right?

1146
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,000
I guess the interesting question then will become again, verification.

1147
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,240
So how does one guarantee that whatever is produced is actually complying with some sort

1148
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,880
of performance measure that we, the users specify?

1149
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,400
And I wonder whether we should be content with probability one, or I'm not sure.

1150
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
Yeah.

1151
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,000
So I guess that's, I mean, I have a specific idea about how I think convex optimization

1152
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,760
and for example, neural networks should play.

1153
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,240
They both play incredibly important roles.

1154
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,420
They both do some things super well, right?

1155
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,360
And I can give you an example and I'll take an example from finance, right?

1156
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,560
Here's something that is just idiotic and does not work.

1157
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:33,240
Like train a neural network that goes directly from Twitter feeds to a trade list, literally

1158
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,000
telling you what to buy and sell.

1159
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That's like idiotic.

1160
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,240
Like, why would you do that, right?

1161
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:44,680
The correct way to do it is take a neural network that basically takes in some like

1162
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:50,200
very complicated data like Twitter feeds and all sorts of other stuff, and then predicts,

1163
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,480
let's say one day and five day forward returns.

1164
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,360
That's a perfect use of it.

1165
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:03,680
That is then plugged in to a convex optimization solver that weighs the risk, the transaction

1166
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,680
costs, the constraints, and then from those, it generates the trade list.

1167
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,520
Nice thing about the convex optimization part is we know what it does.

1168
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,400
It can't do anything crazy.

1169
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,160
Whatever it does, it does for a reason.

1170
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,800
We know how to make it robust.

1171
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,760
We understand precisely what it does.

1172
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,200
And in fact, it can be made so reliable that it just runs real time without any human intervention.

1173
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:31,080
So you have the neural network making very sophisticated forecasts, ones that would be

1174
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,880
very difficult to do using other methods.

1175
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,040
And then that feeds into some, you know, MPC or something like that.

1176
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,840
So to me, that seems like the right way for these two technologies to play together.

1177
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:48,240
Maybe that is the future actually of the interplay of control with machine learning that is nowadays

1178
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,880
the elephant in the room for us control theorists, because it seems to work so well in certain

1179
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,000
domains that it's impossible to ignore it.

1180
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Absolutely.

1181
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah.

1182
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,280
I think maybe it's time to shift gears a little bit.

1183
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:08,200
I was definitely struck by your IEEE Control Systems Award acceptance speech, which I believe

1184
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,720
appeared on CSM, the Control Systems magazine.

1185
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,600
And there there's a fantastic quote that I definitely have to read.

1186
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,320
It goes as follows.

1187
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
For me, teaching is research.

1188
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,640
Teaching is storytelling.

1189
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,360
And the story behind the research is important.

1190
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:27,360
The story should be simple and compelling with substance and maybe a few subplots.

1191
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,880
And it should bring people in, not keep people away, for example, by using some esoteric

1192
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:37,320
field specific dialect or acronyms or assuming that the reader has fully absorbed all details

1193
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,040
of the last few papers.

1194
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,040
I think that's great.

1195
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,520
And I'd like you to elaborate a bit on this.

1196
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,520
Sure.

1197
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,120
What are your thoughts on teaching?

1198
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,120
Yeah.

1199
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:51,240
So, I mean, I really don't distinguish very much between teaching and research in both

1200
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,240
cases.

1201
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,500
And again, it comes back to the, I guess, this training in math and this aesthetic that

1202
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:00,580
what you want is intellectual economy, right?

1203
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:04,460
So no one wants to hear somebody come in and say, oh, there's this method and that method.

1204
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,460
And then you could do this.

1205
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,460
And oh, is it Tuesday?

1206
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,460
Okay.

1207
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,620
We can tell you about, you know, reverse conjugate gradients and blah, blah.

1208
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:15,020
It's like, you know, I think when you hear that, it tells me that this person is kind

1209
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,020
of confused inside, right?

1210
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,900
What you really want is to get it down to its essence.

1211
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,380
And it's not, this is not easy work to try to figure out, you know, what are the three

1212
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,380
concepts?

1213
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,820
A lot of it involves intellectual triage.

1214
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,900
You know, when you see all these fights about the curriculum, you know, in various fields,

1215
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,900
like let's say EE for one, right?

1216
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,980
And someone would say, well, we can't throw out that topic and we can't throw out that

1217
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,380
topic because we taught it for a hundred years, but we have to teach these new topics.

1218
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,420
So and then you, you end up with this kind of, you know, garbled thing.

1219
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,420
So you really have to do the triage.

1220
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:50,020
And the triage really means you're going to let some of that stuff just die anyway.

1221
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:57,380
So I think once you have a very clear picture of a field or a problem, number one, then

1222
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,380
you can teach it.

1223
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,460
So that's the same thing, right?

1224
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,860
You can actually look at a crowd of a couple of hundred people and explain it and have

1225
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,820
them go, okay, yeah, I get it.

1226
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,700
And actually it's a good thing if some of them said, really?

1227
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,280
It's really that simple?

1228
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,380
And then you look at them, you go, yep.

1229
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:15,820
So I'm sorry to be the one to tell you it's, it really is that simple.

1230
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:21,260
In this sense, do you have any advice to like, say, future instructors or future teachers

1231
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,860
at any scale, I guess?

1232
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,860
Yeah, I do.

1233
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:29,420
I mean, for me, teaching is intensely intellectual, right?

1234
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,940
I mean, there's a performance aspect to it, like, and that's also super important.

1235
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,660
It has to, it actually has to do with control and feedback.

1236
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:43,620
But actually designing a lecture or a course or something like that is actually intensely

1237
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,620
intellectual, right?

1238
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:49,060
What you really want is a clean story, right?

1239
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,380
And maybe the details are complicated.

1240
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,880
And in the right social setting, it's fine to go into the details, right?

1241
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,820
If you're with five other people who are experts on that field and you want to talk about some

1242
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:05,540
weird, you know, constraint qualification thing and compactness of the dual, you know,

1243
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,540
by all means, please do it.

1244
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,180
I mean, I'm assuming this is not in public, right?

1245
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,820
So that should not be done in public.

1246
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:16,300
But, you know, I think other than that, you have to figure out, like, what are the main

1247
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,740
things you're saying, and then organize it.

1248
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:24,420
And then it's actually, it's a whole lot easier to teach then, because you're teaching the

1249
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,780
structure to the students.

1250
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,100
You know, it all goes back to this aesthetic of simplicity, right?

1251
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:34,100
I guess this is extremely well demonstrated, not only in the books that we mentioned before,

1252
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:39,060
but also in one of your most recent books, Introduction to Apply Linear Algebra.

1253
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,580
Of course, there will be a link in the description to all the books and publications that we

1254
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,100
mentioned in the podcast.

1255
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:50,060
There you really take another level of abstraction and you make a wonderful exercise for people

1256
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:53,700
to digest and understand linear algebra.

1257
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:59,340
For me, it was, I did read the book and it was extremely clear and very, very interesting

1258
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:03,940
take also on it, because there were lots of applications coming in from all sorts of different

1259
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,420
fields.

1260
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,980
Was that your goal in writing the book?

1261
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,660
Yes, that's right.

1262
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,780
It was a fun book to write.

1263
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:15,260
I mean, it came about because, you know, I don't know, about five, ten years ago, maybe

1264
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,620
ten years ago, I have a colleague and I was just complaining to him always about how terrible

1265
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:24,140
the linear algebra teaching is and how people really, I mean, you don't even really, it's

1266
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:28,940
much more important than knowing, for example, you know, calculus and all this kind of stuff.

1267
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,940
So I kept complaining.

1268
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:35,900
And at one point he turns to me at lunch and he says, look, you can either continue to

1269
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,540
the end of your life complaining about linear algebra education, he said, or you can do

1270
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,540
something about it.

1271
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,540
And I was like, yeah, okay.

1272
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,780
And at that moment, he got me.

1273
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,740
So it was actually really fun.

1274
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,620
And it's actually, so the book, I mean, I like to think of it, you know, basically it's

1275
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:57,580
an extremely elementary, very slow introduction to linear algebra.

1276
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,540
It's all sorts of stuff we don't do.

1277
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:02,260
Like people say, you don't do SVD and you're like, that's right.

1278
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,260
We don't.

1279
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,180
You don't do the determinant, rank, range, null space, fundamental theorem of linear

1280
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,180
algebra.

1281
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,900
I was like, nope, nope, not a one.

1282
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:15,340
So we, it just focuses around basically least squares and what you can do with it.

1283
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,620
And you shouldn't make fun of that because, you know, a very large fraction of entire

1284
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:24,180
industries are run on methods that, you know, are glorified forms of least squares and control

1285
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,900
is one of them, to be perfectly honest.

1286
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:32,420
So I think of it as like, you know, the slow eating movement, you know, this is where you

1287
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:37,100
don't run in and grab something, you know, you have a two or three hour, you know, lunch

1288
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:41,420
and a four hour dinner and you, you actually savor each course, right?

1289
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:45,780
So this is basically the slow linear algebra approach, right?

1290
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,620
I guess there's also like a basic philosophy behind it.

1291
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:54,020
So how many people do you want to draw in with respect to say, I want to say something

1292
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,440
to a selected few.

1293
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,580
That is precisely right.

1294
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,580
So we call certain courses outreach courses.

1295
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:05,100
And first I'll tell you what, here's not an outreach course, a course on the most advanced

1296
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:10,580
topics in information theory, you know, the seven papers published in the last year.

1297
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,580
Okay.

1298
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,660
That's a perfectly good course.

1299
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,140
It's a great course, you know, and you've got your four students in it and it's great.

1300
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,140
Okay.

1301
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,140
The opposite is an outreach course.

1302
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:25,580
And the idea there is to design a course that brings the essence of the ideas to an incredibly

1303
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:29,900
wide group, people in many different departments and fields.

1304
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,460
And there you really have to do the intellectual triage, right?

1305
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,940
You can't tell them everything.

1306
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:38,300
So you really have to kind of think about what are the useful ideas and what are the

1307
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,500
useful methods, right?

1308
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,820
And so it's part of that.

1309
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:46,820
And so it was a really fun exercise, you know, for me and Lieven, my coauthor to do.

1310
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,820
Yeah.

1311
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:52,820
I guess also accessibility is a concept that is very much at the heart of your endeavor.

1312
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:57,180
This is also reflected by the fact that everything that you produce is open source.

1313
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,180
Is that right?

1314
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,180
That's right.

1315
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,020
And you're potentially, well, one of the few that I have in mind that has all of his own

1316
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,140
papers on his website are publicly available, including books.

1317
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:12,660
And I'm just curious, what is it that motivates you to go in the direction of open source?

1318
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:18,140
Well, I think it's extremely important to advancing, I mean, this is good for everyone

1319
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,980
is to make all this material available.

1320
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:24,540
I think it, you know, it advances science and advances research.

1321
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:31,260
And I have gone to places, you know, where I would give a talk and I would have people

1322
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,540
come up to me, you know, afterwards and say something like, you know, we want to especially

1323
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,980
thank you for putting your convex optimization book online.

1324
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:45,460
And they said, because we can buy it, but the price is about two months salary, right?

1325
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:48,260
And so, you know, I didn't think this through carefully.

1326
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:52,340
I would love to revise history and claim that I thought this through and it was a moral

1327
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:57,300
decision and a, you know, rational anyway, honestly, we just fumbled into it.

1328
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,060
But I am also very happy that that's the way I've done it.

1329
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:04,340
I guess another interesting segue to this is related to publishing.

1330
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:10,140
So I would be curious to hear your view about what are the right incentives in that direction

1331
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:15,060
on modern publishing, let's say, and I'm curious about what are your thoughts on the social

1332
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,500
aspect behind science as well?

1333
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,500
Right.

1334
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,180
There's a couple of different aspects of that question.

1335
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:29,460
I mean, one is that there are these predatory publishing companies, you know, that basically

1336
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,940
get essentially for free material from researchers and professors and, you know, this kind of

1337
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:41,100
thing actually then have it reviewed for free by other professors and researchers, right?

1338
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:45,440
I mean, even now the production costs are approximately zero.

1339
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,980
Then they create these things and then price them at appalling prices, knowing that there

1340
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:56,660
is some inelastic demand, like, you know, various libraries are going to get a copy.

1341
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:01,940
And then in addition, I mean, this restricts the free flow of this information.

1342
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,580
So I think, you know, that's a very bad phenomenon.

1343
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,460
It's not going away fast enough for my taste, but I hope it does.

1344
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,460
Now there are some really good publishers, right?

1345
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:17,820
Cambridge University Press is mine and I just think they are awesome in every way.

1346
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,660
I mean, you know, they do a lot and they add a lot.

1347
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:24,380
So I think that's one aspect, the problem with it.

1348
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,980
By the way, it's not always the for-profit publishers, right?

1349
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:33,220
There are nonprofit publishers that are basically not doing good stuff for science, right?

1350
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:37,100
I'm not going to name any, but there are some and, you know, they're not, okay, they're

1351
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,100
not in control.

1352
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:43,460
You know, like IEEE or something like that is on the ethical scale of publishing.

1353
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,620
You know, they're on the positive side.

1354
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,620
I think that's one aspect.

1355
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,740
I think the other aspect is that now that we have the ability to make stuff so widely

1356
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:54,980
available, I think it's a great idea to do it.

1357
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:59,060
And I heard a talk at Stanford about this, about the effects, it was a talk in history

1358
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:04,020
about the effects of the GI Bill, the General Infantry Bill.

1359
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:07,140
So after World War II, there were a lot of returning soldiers in the U.S.

1360
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,380
They didn't know what to do with them, so they sent them to college.

1361
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,180
And this was absolutely radical, right?

1362
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,620
Before that time, you didn't send them to college, right?

1363
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:19,100
It was like, that was for people who were rich or something like that, right?

1364
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:24,100
And you know, lo and behold, it turns out that all those people who would not have gone

1365
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:29,540
to college, some of them were really, really smart, right?

1366
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:33,220
So she went on to name how a lot of these people went on to win Nobel prizes and things

1367
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,220
like that.

1368
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,180
I mean, that's not a good end in itself, but still, I think it's that, right?

1369
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:42,620
If you, you know, if you find some place where people don't have a lot of opportunities for

1370
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:47,580
a wide variety of reasons, the idea that they can, I don't know, I love the idea that

1371
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:54,260
somebody could be, right as we speak right now, I'm hoping some kids in various places

1372
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,900
are reading the Linear Algebra book.

1373
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,540
I just think that's awesome.

1374
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,180
And it's not just a cool thing to do.

1375
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,620
I think actually there'll be some really good benefits.

1376
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,980
Some of those people are going to grow up to do really great stuff.

1377
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:09,940
And hopefully they will listen also to this episode as well, and they'll be inspired.

1378
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,300
I hope so, yeah.

1379
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:17,300
So we're heading towards the end of this episode and in closing, I would like to ask you maybe

1380
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:23,260
a couple of questions related to the future of convex optimization and control, or maybe

1381
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,660
the intersection of both.

1382
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,660
And maybe I'll have another question related to advice that I tend to ask to any guest

1383
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:36,220
that features on the show to future students, future students that happen to be in control

1384
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,580
nowadays or planning to come in the field.

1385
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,180
What would be your best advice in general?

1386
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,180
Yeah.

1387
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,180
So let's see.

1388
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,860
So the first question is about the future and like what's going on.

1389
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:52,140
And I have to say that, you know, what I'm focusing on is actually pretty pedestrian,

1390
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,140
but I think it's important.

1391
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:57,340
So my focus and a lot of what our group does, I mean, we do fun stuff too, but a lot of

1392
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:03,300
it is just to make sure that we build out the infrastructure that we need for very wide

1393
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,260
groups of people to use these methods, right?

1394
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,260
That's what we want to do.

1395
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,180
So if you look at some other fields, they have done so well at this.

1396
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:16,220
I mean, machine learning, unbelievable.

1397
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:21,980
The amount of open source material that's available and incredibly high quality open

1398
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,700
source implementations of things.

1399
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:27,420
I mean, it's, I mean, anyway, my hat goes off to them.

1400
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,180
I mean, I think they've done a spectacular job.

1401
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:34,020
I personally think in optimization, we've done a less good job and in control, maybe

1402
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,700
even worse than that.

1403
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,100
So and a lot of it is kind of pedestrian and boring.

1404
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,700
Like, you know, everybody knows how to implement a, you know, whatever, you know, a QP solver,

1405
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,620
but you know, somebody has got to make one that's open source and reliable and works

1406
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,620
and things like that.

1407
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,220
So we do a lot of that stuff.

1408
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:53,980
When you say these words, you have in mind things like TensorFlow, PyTorch or those kind

1409
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:54,980
of things.

1410
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,980
Yeah.

1411
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,980
Oh my God.

1412
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,980
That's so good.

1413
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,380
I mean, you know, I think they've just done an incredibly good job.

1414
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:04,420
And, you know, if you think about it, there's nothing like that in control.

1415
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,980
Name the open source tools in control that people could use, right?

1416
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,580
I mean, it's a simple question.

1417
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,500
Like, I sit down with someone, I tell them what control is for like five minutes and

1418
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,340
they go, this is awesome.

1419
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,340
This is awesome.

1420
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,740
I want to use this so-called control.

1421
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,780
Like, how do I do it?

1422
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:21,780
Right?

1423
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,460
Like, tell me, you know, what Git repo do I clone?

1424
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,140
Or, you know, what do I need to pip install?

1425
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,140
Right?

1426
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,500
And the answer is, there's like nothing.

1427
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,340
I mean, there's commercial stuff, you know, which, you know, there's for profit stuff.

1428
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,100
So, I mean, it's a little embarrassing for all feel and I'll be honest, I think it's

1429
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,100
a little embarrassing.

1430
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,780
And then you asked about advice.

1431
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,020
And I would say to a student, and this is going to be very personal because it's what

1432
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:48,380
I thought I wish someone had told me, you know, maybe it's also a character flaw on

1433
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,380
my part.

1434
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,380
But, you know, when I was young, I was very snobby and had very high standards and things

1435
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,460
like that.

1436
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,620
And I kind of avoided things that were messy and, you know, a lot of the applied stuff

1437
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,620
was messy and stuff like that.

1438
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:07,540
And it was only much later that I realized how rich an experience you can have when you

1439
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:12,020
learn all the math, but you also learn a lot about, you know, how it's applied and how

1440
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,380
does this field work and how does that field work.

1441
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:20,180
So, my advice to young people is, you know, absolutely focus on the basics.

1442
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,300
Absolutely do that.

1443
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,220
But also, you know, spend a little quality time as you, I think you used the word traveling.

1444
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,820
So, doing some intellectual traveling.

1445
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,060
Go, just, you know, go over to the mountain to the next village and see what they're up

1446
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,060
to.

1447
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,980
You know, maybe if you only go one village, they'll speak a similar dialect, you can figure

1448
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:38,980
out what they're doing.

1449
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:43,900
And because I just think that's so enriching, you know, when you come back to know how people

1450
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,700
in different fields use math.

1451
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,220
I think it's super interesting.

1452
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,860
That would be my advice.

1453
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:53,820
What do you think is the best way to make this happen in a way?

1454
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:59,220
Because it's something that I tend to observe in many, many students nowadays, the, the,

1455
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:03,460
there is definitely this tension towards, you know, learning theory, hardcore theory

1456
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:07,260
and becoming always more and more knowledgeable about that.

1457
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,260
Right.

1458
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:11,340
And in that way, you detach yourself from applications.

1459
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:15,420
I think you're right that I think in some ways, some of the incentives in academia just

1460
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,420
aren't right.

1461
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:21,740
That, you know, the incentive is to write an eight page paper that is completely impenetrable,

1462
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:26,540
that no one understands and so on, and, you know, is poorly written, which is actually,

1463
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:32,060
it's obfuscated, maybe not intentionally, but so I think a lot of the incentives are

1464
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,940
towards that, but I think that's the wrong incentive.

1465
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:41,180
So I would, my advice would be to do something your advisor sometimes will not be on board

1466
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,180
with.

1467
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:45,280
And, and that is, you know, poke around, look at other things, right?

1468
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,600
Take the time to write things that are clear and simple, make some open source implementations

1469
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,880
of various things and just literally just contribute it to the world.

1470
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,960
That'd be one of my pieces of advice.

1471
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,720
The other thing is just hang out and talk to other people in other fields and try to

1472
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,360
hold back on judgment until you've begun to understand their dialect.

1473
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,560
I wish someone had given me that advice.

1474
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,400
I think this is great advice.

1475
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,220
Well, Steven, thanks a lot for your time.

1476
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,040

Oh, thank you so much, Alberto.

1479
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,320
I think this is a great idea and I hope it's going to do a lot of good.

1480
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,320
