0	10440	Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.
10440	23240	Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.
23240	26920	I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.
26920	31200	Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Center of Competency Research on Dependable Ubiquitous
31200	35620	Automation and the International Federation of Automatic Control.
35620	40140	Our guest today is Stephen Boyd, Samsung Professor in the School of Engineering, Department of
40140	43260	Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.
43260	44840	Welcome to the show, Stephen.
44840	45840	Thanks Alberto.
45840	46840	I'm very happy to be here.
46840	51060	Well, Stephen, there's a million different ways that I could start this episode.
51060	54920	You are one of the most well-known researchers in our field.
54920	61000	You're ranked among the top 10 researchers in research.com in the engineering and technology
61000	62840	scientists ranking.
62840	67400	And according to Wikipedia, you are well-known for convex optimization.
67400	72080	But I wonder whether you still identify as a control theorist.
72080	73080	That's a good question.
73080	75200	Actually, I do.
75200	80380	Control was maybe not quite my first field, but it's essentially the field that I grew
80380	82400	up in intellectually.
82400	85720	So I absolutely identify as someone in control.
85720	91200	I do sometimes cringe at the theorist part of it, brings back bad memories and things
91200	92200	like that.
92200	95440	But control, absolutely, I do identify as a control person.
95440	96440	Yeah.
96440	97920	Because your first degree was in mathematics.
97920	98920	That's right.
98920	99920	From Harvard University.
99920	100920	Is that right?
100920	101920	That's right.
101920	102920	My undergraduate degree was in pure math.
102920	106000	And I even went off to Berkeley for a PhD.
106000	110400	I entered in pure math, but within a year I had transferred to EECS.
110400	111400	So I'm curious.
111400	113360	What had drawn you to control?
113360	116640	You know, actually, I'd like to say that I thought about these things very carefully
116640	121040	and looked at different fields and, you know, made a table of the pluses and minuses.
121040	122840	And that's a complete lie.
122840	124000	I did no such thing.
124000	126400	It was just completely accidental.
126400	130920	I had been in pure math, but I was getting an inkling that I wanted to do something more
130920	132360	applied.
132360	137560	And I went over to take some classes in EECS at Berkeley.
137560	142280	I took classes from people like, you know, Eugene Wong, Pravin Varaya, Charlie DeSore.
142280	144720	Now I thought this was just a random sampling of classes.
144720	146120	Of course, it wasn't.
146120	151160	These are some of the most mathematical and brilliant people in, you know, the whole area.
151160	153400	And I thought like, wow, this is awesome.
153400	158280	So I transferred to EECS in my second year of my PhD program.
158280	159280	Yeah.
159280	164200	And I think I was also reading on perhaps the Control Systems magazine, you were touring.
164200	165200	That's true.
165600	167920	And you were involved in a rock and roll band.
167920	172160	I'm not sure how does that blend with, you know.
172160	173160	Not a band.
173160	178400	So actually this, it does kind of explain, you know, my background, which is very weird,
178400	179400	I think.
179400	180400	Yeah.
180400	182160	Is that related to your passion to EECS?
182160	183160	It is.
183160	187200	You know, when I was like, let's say in high school, I did two things.
187200	188200	Pure math.
188200	190200	So I was into pure math very, very young.
190200	191440	I did pure math.
191440	196240	But I also did a very super applied electrical engineering, right?
196240	200480	So I worked as a stagehand at a large theater in Berkeley, and they had rock and roll shows
200480	203040	come in every weekend or something like that.
203040	206800	And maybe one result of that was, you know, by the time I graduated from high school,
206800	210160	I actually, I knew quite well how rock and roll shows work.
210160	211680	I knew exactly what everything did.
211680	215160	I knew, I even started recognizing people who were touring with, you know, different
215160	216560	bands and things like that.
216560	220520	So anyway, I went off to Harvard as an undergrad.
220600	222280	I was in pure math.
222280	225320	By the way, at this point in my life, I was actually fairly clueless.
225320	230120	I didn't really know that, for example, EE and math were related.
230120	231120	Right.
231120	234840	I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous these days, but I don't know.
234840	238720	Well, I was just pretty clueless also, but it was also just a lot less information out
238720	239720	there.
239720	245040	But I guess in a way you were already familiar with the concept of amplifiers, feedback and
245040	246040	all those things.
246040	247040	Yeah, I certainly did.
247120	250720	When I, you know, when I did electrical engineering, we certainly used math, but it wasn't sort
250720	253400	of like, you know, advanced or fancy kind of math.
253400	254400	Yeah.
254400	258880	Anyway, so when I went off to Harvard, I remember I wrote a letter, which of course is like
258880	263920	completely hilarious these days, but I wrote a letter to the head of what was then the
263920	268720	second largest rock and roll sound company in the U.S. called Maryland Sound Industries,
268720	269720	MSI.
269720	273640	I mean, I'm sure everybody wants to do this, but it's probably so shocked to get a letter
273640	276400	from a kid at Harvard that he responded.
276920	279760	So I went out on a test thing, you know, test drive or whatever.
279760	283680	I went for like maybe two, three days with not a lot of sleep.
283680	288840	I had the great advantage that I knew their systems perfectly because they'd come, you
288840	292960	know, they had something like 14 tours every summer, two or three of them would come through
292960	295360	the theater where I worked and I actually knew their equipment.
295360	296360	I knew how it worked.
296360	299680	It was actually quite innovative and cool to have like really kind of cool patch panels
299680	300800	and things.
300800	302000	So I knew how it worked.
302000	305740	So I remember they told me, they said, go wire up the left side of the stage, but don't
305740	310700	even think about powering it up, you know, because if I wired it up wrong, everything
310700	312700	would blow up or something like that.
312700	316260	So I went over, I knew how the system where I fixed it all, I wired it all up, came back
316260	318220	and they said, what are you, an idiot?
318220	319220	What happened?
319220	320220	We said to go wire.
320220	321220	I said, it's done.
321220	322420	And they said, well, that's impossible.
322420	323740	No one could do it that fast.
323740	327580	And the guy comes over and looks at it and he starts like holding his head and he says
327580	329820	like, oh my God, he did.
329820	335580	So then what happened was then rumors started spreading of me being a rock and roll sound
335580	337340	wunderkind.
337340	338340	That's what happened.
338340	340020	And actually, and they got better and better.
340020	342780	I mean, you know, someone said, yeah, he set up the entire stage.
342780	346420	He did an entire set change in between acts in like 90 seconds flat.
346420	348860	You know, it just, all sorts of crazy stories grew.
348860	352100	Anyway, the result was that I was hired by that company.
352100	354900	And I told them, look, it's, this is all wrong.
354900	356440	I've seen your equipment.
356440	358540	That's how I know how to put it together.
358540	362940	And they were like, anyway, the stories kept growing, actually for years they kept growing.
363460	366260	I worked for that company maybe for about six years on and off.
366260	371100	So basically I was either in school or I was essentially on the road doing rock and roll
371100	372100	sound.
372100	375420	So I guess there was your first sliding door.
375420	379420	You could have actually made a career in that direction, but you decided to go to Berkeley
379420	381700	for a PhD in control theory.
381700	382700	Exactly.
382700	386980	I remember very well when the owner of the sound company was like telling me like, dude,
386980	390940	I don't know about this PhD thing, but you should do this right now.
390940	395380	Actually, I thought, I mean, I thought about it, not too much actually, to tell you the
395380	396380	truth.
396380	400340	What was funny was I met him about 10 years ago.
400340	405540	So long, long time, many decades after I had stopped working for them.
405540	407580	And two things happened when we chatted.
407580	408580	It was funny.
408580	413660	Number one is I was thinking to myself, the stories I remember from that time, maybe I've
413660	414660	improved.
414660	415660	I probably, I did improve them.
415660	417300	I don't know if they're true or not.
417300	419980	I mean, they were probably based in truth, but anyway.
420020	423260	He confirmed that some of the stories that I was most suspicious of, these are my own
423260	424260	stories.
424260	425860	He confirmed they were true.
425860	429300	And then reminded me of even crazier stories that I had completely forgotten.
429300	437180	So anyway, so, so anyway, but somehow the appeal of Volterra series was more, you know,
437180	440060	when you put it that way, I think the answer is no.
440060	441060	I can tell you this.
441060	446740	If you're, if you're mixing house in a 15,000 seat venue, right.
446740	451940	And you know, on your headphones, the stage manager says, we're T minus four seconds.
451940	457300	And you pop your button across the, to unmute all the sub masters on the mixing console.
457300	460820	You know, this, this beats Volterra series.
460820	461820	I'm just going to say it.
461820	462820	I'm sorry.
462820	463820	It's good.
463820	464820	No.
464820	469580	And anyway, I guess when you were in Berkeley, you were surrounded by people that nowadays
469580	471420	are considered giants in the field.
471420	475540	I'm thinking of Chua, Dessour, Sastry, just to name a few.
475540	478900	And I was wondering, what was your experience there?
478900	480540	Oh, it was great.
480540	485580	I mean, they are the reason I switched over to EECS.
485580	492300	I mean, you know, they were, and in very different ways, you know, Dessour was precise and very
492300	495020	clear in a beautiful way.
495020	497500	Chua just knew so much.
497500	501580	It was just, you know, had an interest just all over the map and all sorts of weird areas
501580	506180	involving, you know, nonlinear circuits, but also all sorts of crazy stuff.
506180	509980	And then Sastry, Shankar Sastry was amazing.
509980	514700	He was this kind of young, I think I called him a child professor because he really was.
514700	517460	I mean, he was just a kid.
517460	520100	Had just an infinite amount of energy.
520100	524900	These three were just, you know, if you take the convex hull of these three, it's very
524900	525900	impressive.
525900	526900	Let's put it that way.
526900	529900	So, yeah, they had a big influence on me.
529900	533820	And your investigations there were, as you mentioned, fairly theoretical.
533820	538420	I mean, yeah, you know, in doing my homework for this podcast, I was checking your first
538420	544980	paper with Leon Chua, I believe, on the passivity criterion for TIN ports.
544980	550620	And I actually love the abstract, it was incredible, because it already gives a bit of a hint about
550620	554340	your future style in a way, which is quite predictive.
554340	558700	You say there are existing proofs of the passivity criterion for linear time invariant
558700	565460	distributed ports are either incorrect or too involved, requiring the use of advanced
565460	567460	mathematics such as distribution theory.
567460	571940	This paper presents a simple but completely rigorous proof using only basic, real and
571940	572980	complex analysis.
572980	575260	I think that's wonderful already.
575260	576260	That's great.
576260	580900	Now, in my defense, I will say that that was at the very beginning of my transition from
580900	581900	math to ECS.
582460	585900	I guess a lot of people think about, you know, how is, what are the good parts about math
585900	589620	and why should you learn some and stuff like that.
589620	593140	One aesthetic in math is simplicity.
593140	594140	I mean, you know-
594140	595140	Occam's razor.
595140	596140	Yeah.
596140	597140	Some people make stuff really complicated.
597140	601780	And, you know, there's stories, possibly even true of, you know, Russian mathematicians
601780	605340	who spend seven years working on a paper and someone says, why?
605340	608380	And he said, the proof used to be seven pages.
608380	609780	Now it's three quarters of a page.
609780	611420	Now I'm happy with it, right?
611940	618300	And so, you know, so there is this very clean and lean aesthetic in math.
618300	621100	And I think it's, it's actually guided me.
621100	622100	I'm very attracted to it.
622100	623100	I won't say I'm not.
623100	624100	Right.
624100	625100	It's, I think it's very cool.
625100	628460	You think that's the use of theory in practice or is there-
628460	630660	Oh, I think that's precisely the theory, right?
630660	631900	I think that's exactly the idea.
631900	637460	I think that, you know, I see a lot of people who imagine that theory is used in practice
637460	638460	like this, right?
638500	643220	Like I go grab a theorem from a journal and then I apply it or whatever, whatever that
643220	644220	means.
644220	645220	I don't even know what that means.
645220	646780	But the point is that's completely wrong, right?
646780	651420	I'm not aware of any theorem that's actually used in anything.
651420	654740	I mean, maybe in some kind of, you know, number theory or something, but it doesn't matter
654740	656020	for cryptography.
656020	658540	But other than that, I'm not aware of any.
658540	665740	So in my opinion, the real value of math in applied settings, control being one of them,
665780	670020	or at least one of them, is what it gives you is clarity of thought.
670020	673560	And that's extremely important in practice.
673560	674740	So let me explain that, right?
674740	679220	If I, you know, here we are in Silicon Valley and people build stuff and, you know, I could
679220	681940	get one team and say, you know, go build this thing.
681940	685700	And with a lot of high level tools now, you can bang something together that looks like
685700	686700	it's working.
686700	692380	I mean, there's kind of a UI and the app works and something happens, but there's another
692380	694180	style and I've seen other people do this.
694180	695180	It's just beautiful.
695620	698700	And there are people who think about it very deeply, often trained in things like math
698700	703200	or something abstract, and they don't do anything for a day or two, right?
703200	706260	After a day or two, they look up and they go, hey, you know what?
706260	712660	The 87 things that we've been asked to implement are actually all instances of only three different
712660	713660	things.
713660	716860	So we're going to implement that correctly.
716860	718840	And then, you know, blah, blah, blah, it'll all fit together.
718840	721620	So what happens is they'll build something.
721620	723700	And here's where this is practically useful.
723700	728460	You know, when people just hack something together to knock off 87 requirements, it's
728460	734560	going to be horrible code, badly structured, there's going to be all sorts of weird dependencies.
734560	735560	It won't be correct.
735560	737700	You'll never be able to actually debug it.
737700	742260	You definitely cannot extend it or anything like that or modify it.
742260	745660	Whereas when you see people who actually kind of think abstractly and actually took the
745660	752660	time to work out what were the correct abstractions, you get beautiful, lean code that has very
752660	754180	high probability being correct.
754180	755180	It's extensible.
755180	759420	And then just as a purely practical matter, the cost of ownership of that project is a
759420	760420	lot less.
760420	764180	Because, you know, it actually will, number one, it will work.
764180	765620	Number two, it's extensible.
765620	766700	It's maintainable.
766700	768420	It's like Linux, for example.
768420	770220	That's a good model of this.
770220	772740	Well, here, there's a lot to unpack already.
772740	777420	I think implicitly, you're touching also on the concept of maybe something that we're
777420	783580	going to talk about, the concept of disciplined convex programming, but also generally the
783580	788820	idea that maybe this is actually the value of human creativity in a way that of parsing
788820	794140	through different concepts and being able to synthesize in a way what is important and
794140	800740	how to categorize different ideas or I guess classes in the language of computer science.
800740	801740	I'm not sure.
801740	804300	But yeah, maybe taking a step back.
804300	808900	I feel like we're diverging from your PhD at Berkeley.
808900	815780	I just wanted to understand how that actually relates to you today in a way.
815780	820860	So how do we connect a person that, you know, had this crazy interest for mathematics, full
820860	827260	time operators, very, very theoretical concepts with the person that you are today?
827260	834060	So something that I would associate you to very applied concepts, very useful in a way
834060	837220	concepts for everyday engineering.
837220	839060	Yeah, it does apply.
839060	844260	As I said, that was sort of the beginning of my transition from pure math to EECS in
844260	846420	general to more practical things.
846420	848260	You can call it applied math.
848260	850380	Control was one interest.
850380	852020	So I think that was the very beginnings of it.
852220	856300	Actually, it's since then, I mean, I'm still on that journey.
856300	864260	And it's super interesting to me to see how people in different fields use math.
864260	868140	And you know, by this time in my life, I've visited many, many fields.
868140	870780	So I've been a sort of a visitor at many.
870780	874700	But I've actually spent time, you know, spent like, you know, whatever, you know, a couple
874700	877100	of year periods in a bunch of fields.
877100	879900	I mean, circuit design was one, that was very weird.
879900	881740	Finance is another.
882460	885700	And what's interesting to me are the anthropological issues.
885700	889980	How do people use math in practical settings?
889980	893380	So it's really questions like, you know, how do they think about this?
893380	896860	Do they use a lot of brute force computing?
896860	897900	It's so interesting.
897900	901580	And what's very interesting to me is I found out that in these different fields, which
901580	904700	are, you know, speak completely different dialects.
904700	911180	I mean, they're not completely mutually unintelligible, I can guarantee it.
911180	916460	What's interesting when you look at that is the same topics come up over and over again.
916460	920940	You know, one would be, you know, how good is your model?
920940	924660	And the acknowledgement that your model is not perfect, right?
924660	929780	You know, in let's say circuit design, you know, spice model for a process that's already
929780	933380	pretty mature, that's actually pretty good.
933380	938580	In finance, you know, the models are, or as a friend of mine says, he's super happy if
938580	940420	he gets the sign right, right?
940420	945820	So, you know, this is not Newtonian mechanics, right?
945820	948060	But then, you know, robustness is another one.
948060	954700	Like, you know, how do you design something or decide on good actions or build a good
954700	959620	model that's going to be robust to things being not what you thought they were?
959620	962020	And that comes up in every single field.
962020	966540	They all have interesting different ways to talk about it and think about it.
966540	971900	And some of the methods that are used are from one field or other might look very unsophisticated,
971900	973620	but in fact work very well.
973620	978540	So that's sort of very interesting to me to see how people do this.
978540	984800	I guess that's really the value in a way of traveling, at least from an intellectual perspective.
984800	987620	There is this quote from Mark Twain.
987620	991540	He says, travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow mindedness.
991540	994860	And it seems like this very well resonates with what you just said.
994860	995860	Yeah.
996180	1000740	So, you know, whether traveling intellectually taught you something that you didn't know before.
1000740	1001740	Absolutely.
1001740	1004580	I strongly recommend it to everyone.
1004580	1007060	Just to know a little bit about different fields.
1007060	1010260	One of the interesting things is that you really get people speaking different dialects
1010260	1011740	and you can't.
1011740	1017920	They are mutually unintelligible unless someone is there who actually speaks both dialects.
1017920	1020380	It's very hard to translate from one to the other.
1020380	1023940	And now I know when I go into a field and I listen and I'm like, these people sound
1024020	1025820	like idiots to me.
1025820	1032060	But now I know from experience that I should just calm down, you know, wait a couple of months.
1032060	1036060	Maybe some of these terms are going to start and then I'll start understanding what they're saying.
1036060	1037380	And in fact, they're not idiots.
1037380	1039740	And this has happened to me many, many times.
1039740	1042460	And it's so it's actually quite interesting.
1042460	1046100	I think it's very good for all of academia and for research.
1046100	1050300	It's super good to travel, to look at other areas.
1050300	1056420	I guess your first travel was from control itself towards the world, I guess, of computation.
1056420	1057820	Would it be fair to say?
1057820	1058820	Yeah.
1058820	1063500	Actually, I think the very first academic stuff I did was on modeling of nonlinear systems
1063500	1065820	via Volterra series.
1065820	1069420	I also dabbled in, at that time, adaptive control.
1069420	1074620	And then actually became interested in designing control systems using numerical optimization
1074620	1075620	methods.
1075620	1076620	Right.
1076620	1077620	So that's one thing I did.
1077940	1083100	I think that's the branch that grew into what I ended up really focusing on.
1083100	1087420	And, you know, what I liked about that stuff, I mean, that was a long time ago, what was
1087420	1094540	very interesting about it was that it appealed to me aesthetically because it was both theoretical,
1094540	1099380	it was using all sorts of stuff about, you know, the parametrization of stabilizing controllers.
1099380	1101980	It was using kind of theoretical stuff.
1101980	1106740	It also used computation to actually solve problems.
1106860	1109580	And then at the same time, it was actually extremely useful, right?
1109580	1111700	It actually solved real problems.
1111700	1115420	So I think that combination of things just really appealed to me.
1115420	1117500	And I mean, it still does, to be honest.
1117500	1118980	So I think it's great.
1118980	1119980	Yeah.
1119980	1125420	In fact, I mean, what I saw, you know, doing a bit of searching was that you got your PhD
1125420	1127260	in 1985.
1127260	1133060	And from 1988, what I observed is that the word computation starts to appear in your
1133060	1137980	publications and it grows from 1988 to 1992.
1137980	1143340	It goes like one, one, and then three, four per year.
1143340	1145420	So it definitely seems to resonate with you.
1145420	1148940	And at the same time, also the keyword optimization as well.
1148940	1154740	So you were moving definitely in that direction from the world of nonlinear systems and very
1154740	1157060	complicated mathematical tools, I would say.
1157060	1158060	Yeah.
1158060	1163180	And I very much like the idea that sort of, you know, some advanced mathematical things
1163180	1168980	like convex optimization, actually they are very mathematical, but they're also unbelievably
1168980	1172460	useful, which is super interesting because, you know, you normally think of this weird
1172460	1177700	axis where, you know, on one side, there's like pure theory and it's pretty useless,
1177700	1178700	right?
1178700	1181980	And then on the other side, you have something that's, you know, there's almost no theory
1181980	1182980	and it's super useful.
1182980	1185380	And of course, you do see some of that.
1185380	1189380	But what's interesting is that there are a lot of things that are both and I find that
1189380	1191540	sort of very interesting.
1191540	1193700	I think it's very cool.
1193700	1196860	I definitely wanted to talk about this topic.
1196860	1202100	Both of your most well-known publications or books rather, Linear Metrics Inequalities
1202100	1209220	in Systems and Control Theory and Convex Optimization are masterpieces in this domain.
1209220	1215240	And they both involve quite a bit of convex optimization and they do turn into something
1216100	1219840	that is incredibly useful and that's perhaps also reflected in the success, at least in
1219840	1223160	terms of citations, if we take that as a measure.
1223160	1227220	And I'm wondering, I mean, one question I would have for you is why should everybody
1227220	1230320	know a bit of convex optimization?
1230320	1231320	That's a good question.
1231320	1232320	Yeah.
1232320	1235160	Of course, it does depend on our definition of everybody because if you really mean just
1235160	1240680	everybody, then I'm not sure I'd be on board with that statement.
1240680	1247040	So if you mean anyone who does any kind of quantitative work, then I would totally agree
1247040	1248600	with the statement.
1248600	1253640	And yeah, I can say a little bit about why I think it is important for anyone who...
1253640	1255760	And that's many, many fields, right?
1255760	1260600	And there's the obvious ones like whatever, all of engineering, right?
1260600	1262680	Much of social science these days.
1262680	1265160	So maybe quite a lot of science.
1265160	1272400	So the reason is it's an incredibly important tool to actually solve optimization problems,
1272400	1273400	right?
1273400	1278520	That the usual sort of story on optimization problems is here's what I'd like to solve.
1278520	1282280	And then basically, I mean, people don't admit it when they're teaching these classes, but
1282280	1285560	the bottom line is we can't actually solve most of those problems, right?
1285560	1287120	You just can't, right?
1287120	1289520	I mean, maybe that doesn't matter.
1289520	1295000	We have heuristics that do well and if you get a good model or if you make good
1295000	1298640	predictions or if your hedge fund makes money, you're fine.
1298640	1301000	You don't need to worry about that.
1301000	1307240	But the fact is there is a group of mathematical optimization problems that we can solve numerically
1307240	1310600	via computers really, really well.
1310600	1315720	I mean, I used to go around and say things like, oh, the great advantage is you get the
1315720	1316920	global optimum.
1316920	1318240	There's no apologies.
1318240	1322600	You don't have a little star and a footnote and the footnote when you say, oh, I minimize
1322600	1327760	this and the footnote says, well, maybe or maybe I didn't or something like that, right?
1327760	1332280	So I used to do that until actually I remember I met someone who was a senior executive at
1332280	1334800	a large semiconductor firm.
1334800	1342840	So I was chatting with him and I said, look, this is the best design of this thing that
1342840	1343840	there is.
1343840	1346480	And he looked at me and said, how could you possibly know that?
1346480	1347480	How could you know?
1347480	1350040	And I realized like for a normal person, that's the correct response.
1350040	1351920	Like what hubris, right?
1351960	1355120	What would cause a person to say this is the best there is, right?
1355120	1360240	And I said, I started my usual spiel, which was like, hey, look, you know, basically,
1360240	1364040	you know, it has to do with the mathematical properties of the functions involved and I'm
1364040	1365160	blabbering on and on.
1365160	1368640	And he just puts his hand up and says, stop, stop right there.
1368640	1369640	And I was like, what is it?
1369640	1375200	And he said, look, fine, he said, but that's only the best design for this particular circuit
1375200	1376200	configuration.
1376200	1377400	And I was like, yeah, you're right.
1377400	1378880	And he said, but there's lots of others.
1378880	1380240	How do you know there's not another one?
1380240	1382080	And I said, you're right.
1382080	1386880	And then he said, now you be quiet and I'm going to tell you what's useful about convex
1386880	1387880	optimization.
1387880	1390440	So here I am being lectured by a senior circuit designer.
1390440	1395920	By the way, so, and he says to me, look, I don't care about your global stuff.
1395920	1396920	Who cares?
1396920	1398920	If you do real engineering, nothing is global.
1398920	1400280	And I didn't even know what that means.
1400280	1401280	And I said, okay, granted.
1401280	1404120	And then he says, look, here's what's useful.
1404120	1407480	When you solve these things, you don't need a starting point, number one.
1407480	1412040	Number two, you don't need to babysit the algorithm.
1412040	1417720	And he said, we've looked at a lot of these algorithms that do circuit design and stuff
1417720	1418800	like that.
1418800	1421640	They require a starting point, right?
1421640	1426520	He said, then they take off and they'll go from a good design to a quite good design.
1426520	1428600	And he said, do you know what we call a good design around here?
1428600	1429600	I'm like, no, what?
1429600	1432000	And he said, done, done.
1432000	1436840	He said, we are under unbelievable business pressure to get things out there.
1437200	1440280	And I said, well, since you have a good design, like we don't want to get another 15% of performance
1440280	1441280	out of it.
1441280	1442280	We want to tape it out.
1442280	1446280	So I listened and I realized like, oh my God, like he's totally right.
1446280	1449880	And what's interesting is how it, where it goes in control.
1449880	1457200	So in control, you know, if you embed a convex optimization solver in a control system, as
1457200	1461960	you might do an MPC or for actuator allocation, it's not a question.
1461960	1465520	It's not like the fact that you're getting global optimal, who cares?
1465520	1472560	What matters is these algorithms can be made so reliable that they can be embedded in systems
1472560	1476960	with absolutely no oversight that solve things a thousand times a second in safety, critical
1476960	1477960	things.
1477960	1479400	And they just don't fail.
1479400	1482640	That's actually the real value I would say, right?
1482640	1483640	Of this.
1483640	1485560	So, so anyway, I think there are a lot of practical values.
1485560	1489200	They're not the obvious ones that maybe I thought when I was young, let's put it that
1489200	1490200	way.
1490200	1491200	Yeah.
1491200	1495280	And I find very interesting the fact that you really interfaced with the industrial
1495280	1497440	world and really hardcore levels.
1497440	1502240	I was reading that your CVX gen, which I'm sure we're going to talk about later, has
1502240	1505640	been used in SpaceX missions recently.
1505640	1507840	And I was wondering what was your experience there?
1507840	1511520	Like thinking about the cultural difference, if you want, between the world of academia
1511520	1516760	in which you presumably live, but also the other world, the real world in a sense.
1516760	1517760	Yeah.
1517760	1518760	So that's interesting.
1518760	1519760	Actually, it wasn't used recently.
1520320	1523440	Every single one from the prototypes through, it's just in production now.
1523440	1524440	Yeah.
1524440	1528320	So, and to be completely clear about that, how much I had to do with it was very, very
1528320	1529320	little.
1529320	1535360	It was my student, Thomas Lipp and Lars Blackmore, who were the ones who really pioneered these
1535360	1536360	things.
1536360	1543000	It's wonderful to see these things realized in very sophisticated settings and also to
1543000	1544520	deliver incredible value.
1544520	1549000	You know, classical control and things like that just wasn't going to cut it for this,
1549680	1550680	So that was very gratifying.
1550680	1555880	I mean, there's been a lot of others, you know, in areas like finance and control and
1555880	1559960	energy management that it's very nice just to see people using this stuff.
1559960	1566000	I mean, I remember once I went to Tesla and some people who ran their grid scale storage
1566000	1567000	products.
1567000	1568400	It's very cool, right?
1568400	1571040	They have a giant cargo container full of batteries.
1571040	1574280	They have a Raspberry Pi and on it is running CVX Pi.
1574280	1575280	Wow.
1575280	1576880	And they told me, actually, it's very funny.
1577640	1578640	They told me their problem.
1578640	1579640	I listened.
1579640	1583320	It wasn't quite convex, but there's a street fighting trick, you know?
1583320	1586720	So I'm sitting there and they finish and I said, well, how do you solve it?
1586720	1589560	Expecting that I'm going to have to tell them this trick.
1589560	1593920	They proceed to then tell me precisely the trick and articulate it perfectly.
1593920	1597320	And I'm like, whoa, how did you guys figure that out?
1597320	1598320	And then they looked at each other.
1598320	1600120	They looked at me and they said, we took your class.
1600120	1603080	So I was like, okay, good, good.
1603080	1604600	So I was quite proud of that.
1604920	1608280	And actually it's one of those things where I said, well, so you don't need me.
1608280	1609280	That's great.
1609280	1610280	This is awesome.
1610280	1611280	And thanks for showing me this.
1611280	1614720	So I was very gratified that it happened.
1614720	1618600	Maybe talking about convex optimization and your classes and that, I mean, I'm sure also
1618600	1624400	we're going to talk about teaching later because you're the author of a legendary series on
1624400	1627880	convex optimization on YouTube and that is free access.
1627880	1630640	And there's definitely a lot to talk about there as well.
1630640	1635440	But I was trying to trace back a history of convex optimization somehow.
1635440	1640560	And of course the concepts of convexity go all the way back to, you know, Euclid, Archimedes
1640560	1642280	and optimization.
1642280	1645560	We can trace it back to Fermat, Lagrange and blah, blah, blah.
1645560	1651800	But I was wondering whether the actual start of convex optimization should be pinpointed
1651800	1655680	to linear programming, simplex algorithm, Danzig.
1655680	1658080	And then it seems like a very recent theory.
1658080	1659080	I think that's right.
1659080	1664160	The theory of convexity was codified maybe around the turn of the last century, right?
1664160	1668600	So that's when you would get, you know, but of course it had been used before that.
1668600	1673240	I mean, we still see fields where people are using essentially convex optimization and
1673240	1675640	either don't know it or don't point it out, right?
1675640	1679400	So you look at something, you go, oh, that's just a conjugate of that function, like, or
1679400	1680400	something like that.
1680400	1683680	And so the ideas were there, actually the inequalities were there.
1683680	1687760	It just got a common name, you know, around the turn of the last century.
1687800	1694520	Now, it was pretty much a theory then because computation was very limited.
1694520	1698320	But starting, you know, around mid 40s, I would say, is when things get interesting
1698320	1703400	and that coincides precisely with the development of the digital computer.
1703400	1708440	And you know, it wasn't long after, I mean, if you think about Danzig coming up with,
1708440	1714520	you know, a simplex method for linear programming, it was not that long after the development
1714520	1716760	of the first actual computers, right?
1716760	1722680	So, and I remember I actually overlapped with him at Stanford when I first came and I remember
1722680	1727960	him telling me something like that it was a huge big deal to solve like a linear program
1727960	1733840	with like 30 or 40 variables, which, you know, is laughable now, but he said that it was
1733840	1737720	a lot of effort and when they did it, they all like, you know, they went out and had
1737720	1738720	some beer to celebrate.
1738720	1740520	I mean, it was a big deal.
1740520	1744400	So it was one of the very first applications of digital computers.
1744400	1750080	But if I were going to say, you know, when does the, I mean, from a mathematical point
1750080	1753720	of view, you'd have to say, end of the 19th century, right?
1753720	1757840	But from the practical point of view, I think you'd have to say around 1950.
1757840	1758840	1950.
1758840	1759840	Yeah.
1759840	1764880	And, and I guess then the developments were the, I mean, the most important ones were
1764880	1769680	the development of the interior point methods, I guess, ellipsoid method probably.
1769680	1770680	Yeah.
1770680	1771680	Well, those are later.
1771680	1772680	Yeah.
1772960	1774640	So you actually had two traditions.
1774640	1781000	It was actually very interesting in the West, in optimization, OR, and these kinds of areas.
1781000	1787200	The tradition was you'd either work on like linear programming or nonlinear programming,
1787200	1788200	right?
1788200	1789200	And that was the distinction.
1789200	1790960	I mean, it makes perfect sense.
1790960	1795080	I mean, it was fine, you know, and it's like linear programming was easy, interesting,
1795080	1801160	you know, nonlinear was more expressive, but, you know, it was complicated and maybe you
1801160	1804600	didn't even get the solution when you apply these algorithms to it.
1804600	1808760	And I think in the Soviet Union, however, there was a big focus, this is now in the
1808760	1813240	sixties, on actually convex optimization.
1813240	1818320	And so there was a lot of work done in the sixties and seventies and eighties in the
1818320	1819320	Soviet Union.
1819320	1824200	I think we will talk about that later, where they really focused on convex optimization
1824200	1827680	and they came up with all sorts of things.
1827680	1831040	Interior point method was an interesting, super interesting method.
1831040	1836840	Of course, it's actually in practice, you know, pretty much not used and not useful.
1836840	1841080	And of course the converse of that is something like the simplex method, which in the sixties
1841080	1845520	was shown to be worst case exponential, but it didn't stop the hundreds of thousands of
1845520	1851680	people using it every day because it just worked unbelievably well in practice, right?
1851680	1853800	Interior point methods was also an interesting thing.
1853800	1858440	You know, that was a big, you know, rage in the late eighties and the nineties.
1858440	1862880	And I mean, it was crazy, but actually it turned out when people went back and looked
1862880	1865160	at the history, there were precursors of this.
1865160	1866680	I mean, this always happens.
1866680	1872000	And it turned out there was essentially a very clean interior point method that was
1872000	1874820	from the sixties by this guy Deakin.
1874820	1878480	And I remember corresponding with some of my friends who were then in Moscow at the
1878480	1879480	time.
1879480	1880880	And they said, they said something great.
1880880	1887240	They said, Deakin is hardly known in the Soviet Union and unheard of in the West.
1887240	1888240	Right.
1888240	1890480	You know, you look at these things like they were pretty good.
1890480	1897260	They were like competitive with the algorithms that people in the West were writing and writing
1897260	1899120	papers on.
1899120	1903880	And they imagined that this was like revolutionary and, you know, nothing like this has ever
1903880	1904880	been done before.
1904880	1906120	And the answer was, you're wrong.
1906120	1909760	It was done in 1967, you know, in the Soviet Union.
1909760	1914920	The interplay between the Soviet Union and, you know, the Western world, both, you know,
1914920	1919400	mathematics, but also I would say in control are so interesting.
1919400	1924520	And I think there's a fantastic summary in your book on linear matrix inequalities about
1924520	1929480	the key events also in that domain specifically, not just in convex optimization.
1929480	1933680	And there you're actually right that it is fair to say that Yakubovich is the father
1933680	1938560	of the field of LMIs and Lyapunov the grandfather of the field.
1938560	1939560	Yes.
1940360	1943280	And the new development at the stage where you write the book is the ability to directly
1943280	1944760	solve that's right.
1944760	1945760	General LMIs.
1945760	1952120	I thought that was a fantastic sentence, but it seems like Willems in his 1971 paper is
1952120	1957080	the one that actually points out there is a known appreciation that's right for LMIs
1957080	1958080	in control.
1958080	1959080	Yeah.
1959080	1960080	So that also has a very long history.
1960080	1965240	I mean, it goes to Lyapunov and it goes even into the 19th century and basically comes,
1965240	1972000	I think if you really traced it back to physics, to the concept of an invariant at first, right?
1972000	1975920	That's a quantity that doesn't change as the system evolves, right?
1975920	1981340	So, you know, if you have a closed system, it could be the total mass or the, you know,
1981340	1987360	or the total energy or the angular momentum about some axis or something, right?
1987360	1992840	And then it doesn't take much to generalize that to put an inequality there and to say,
1992840	1994760	how about a dissipated quantity?
1994760	2000120	That's a quantity that's always decreasing along trajectories of a very complex system.
2000120	2004760	And the whole point that was recognized even in the 19th century was that there were times
2004760	2010680	when you could identify something that was either an invariant or a dissipated quantity
2010680	2015640	without actually being able to solve for the trajectory, right?
2015640	2020720	So you could have a three, four body gravitational problem and say, at that point, you could
2020720	2025080	do this, I mean, numerically, which would be horrible because it'd be actual people,
2025080	2031080	you know, with, I guess, you know, hand calculators or something, but, you know, adding machines.
2031080	2035080	But what was interesting, it's super interesting, right, that you could actually, it was fully
2035080	2036520	appreciated then.
2036520	2042080	And of course, that comes up in control, right, where you'd say, I can't write down what the
2042080	2043320	trajectory of this is.
2043320	2046800	He says, but I'm about to prove to you that it's stable.
2047280	2051040	You know, in control, we don't even think about that because it's a part of control,
2051040	2052040	that idea.
2052040	2055480	But if you think about what that sounds like, I mean, if you really try to pretend you're
2055480	2060280	no longer 22 and a grad student learning this for the first time, you know, somehow the
2060280	2061280	wonder is lost.
2061280	2066680	Because you really should say, oh, my God, that's amazing, like, you can't tell me what
2066680	2070000	the solution of this differential equation, you're like, that's right, I have no idea
2070000	2071000	what's going to happen.
2071000	2077760	But I can guarantee you that the total energy is conserved or that the total energy is dissipated.
2077760	2078760	It's kind of cool, right?
2078760	2080380	I think you have to admit.
2080380	2081380	It's incredible.
2081380	2084480	And I wonder whether you think this is the most important concept?
2084480	2087920	I mean, how do you look back at the book on LMIs?
2087920	2089560	Yeah, I think that that's right.
2089560	2094760	I mean, that's the essential concept, which, you know, you can trace back to the 19th century,
2094760	2100760	you know, specifically for linear matrix inequalities, which basically looks at quadratic functions
2101520	2105000	that are these quantities that either decrease or invariant.
2105000	2107920	Usually in most interesting applications, they're dissipative, right?
2107920	2108920	They decrease.
2108920	2113800	And, you know, in the 40s, people had worked out, like, really cool ways to solve these
2113800	2114840	inequalities, right?
2114840	2115840	Very simple ones, right?
2115840	2119840	And there were graphical methods, you'd literally get out some graph paper and draw some curve.
2119840	2124920	And, you know, if it stays away from some point in the complex plane, then anyway, that
2124920	2125920	was one.
2126080	2131320	There was a connection to control figured out with things like algebraic Riccati equations.
2131320	2135520	But I think the really interesting thing, and as you say, Willems and others, you know,
2135520	2140960	had already observed this, is that in the 70s, I think there were some papers in the
2140960	2148840	Soviet Union about directly solving to find one of these, you know, dissipated quantities
2148840	2156200	or a so-called Lyapunov function by numerical methods, which is, I think, you know, it's
2156200	2158320	not a huge thing, but it's pretty cool, right?
2158320	2162120	You know, up until that point, the way you've, I mean, look, let's think about the way people
2162120	2164040	find Lyapunov functions, right?
2164040	2168080	One is you start with physics and you say, well, let's just add the kinetic energy plus
2168080	2169200	a potential energy.
2169200	2173320	And that doesn't work, you add another term or two, and then voila, it worked.
2173320	2174320	You got something, right?
2174320	2177000	I mean, another method would be from optimal control.
2177000	2182240	So you'd actually, you'd write down an optimal control problem and you'd work out, let's
2182240	2186360	say, the value function of it.
2186360	2190480	So these were the traditional ways, right, through analytical methods and other stuff.
2190480	2194480	Anyway, so it's really interesting, the idea that you can actually compute them.
2194480	2197920	And that's where I think convex optimization comes in, right?
2197920	2204680	It turns out that in a whole lot of cases, you can actually compute these Lyapunov functions
2204680	2206160	using convex optimization.
2206320	2207320	And I think that's super interesting.
2207320	2211960	By the way, I think it's under, you know, I look back at that book now and I'm a little
2211960	2212960	bit horrified.
2212960	2218800	I mean, I gave it to somebody the other day who was interested.
2218800	2219800	I said, take a copy.
2219800	2221040	But I had to warn them.
2221040	2226920	I was like, look, you know, full disclosure, you know, it's really technical and it's weird
2226920	2227920	and all that.
2227920	2231640	And it predated the term semi-definite programming.
2231640	2235680	So we have some bizarre name for it, like the eigenvalue problem.
2236200	2240680	So I just said, look, just heads up, this is not a fun book.
2240680	2245160	But yeah, but I do think actually a lot of that stuff is super useful and actually hasn't
2245160	2247480	been fully explored.
2247480	2252240	So I'm actually wondering, do you think that is the last word on the topic or do you see
2252240	2254960	a future for what is the next step?
2254960	2257800	Honestly, I've been thinking about it on and off for a couple of years, but if I were going
2257800	2264920	to do something really weird, I might go back to that and build, you know, build some beautiful
2264920	2268040	software system for people to do that kind of stuff.
2268040	2270920	I mean, there were, of course, there were things in the past that did this.
2270920	2275560	There was this thing called LMI Lab or whatever, and there was a lot of other stuff driving
2275560	2276560	it.
2276560	2279920	But, you know, but just make it so that actually you could synthesize controllers and, you
2279920	2283160	know, performance certificates this way.
2283160	2288400	I mean, you, I think at one point you asked, you know, what were the essential ideas?
2288400	2290800	There's actually another very powerful idea that's in there.
2290800	2294480	And again, like many others, it can be traced way back.
2295040	2298920	But the idea, you know, in the eighties and nineties and aughts, people were thinking
2298920	2303640	a lot about, you know, verifying performance of something and the way we all know how this
2303640	2305040	actually works in the real world.
2305040	2308840	The way it works in the real world is someone designs a controller and they put some saturation
2308840	2312960	in and then they tweak this gain and they do that and they do this and they gain schedule
2312960	2316960	something and what they fiddle around and then they simulate it with a high fidelity
2316960	2319360	simulator on a lot of stuff.
2319360	2321440	And after a while they declare, I think it works.
2321440	2322440	There it is.
2322440	2323440	Right.
2323440	2328520	And then they pass this controller over the wall to, you know, some control theorist who's,
2328520	2333040	you know, typically hiding in the back room, right back room, meaning they're in a place
2333040	2334880	where they should never come out in public.
2334880	2335880	Right.
2335880	2339000	Which I, which I think is probably the correct way to handle most control theorists.
2339000	2340000	Anyway.
2340000	2343560	So they throw the policy over the wall to this control theorist and they say, please
2343560	2346840	verify this, please validate it.
2346840	2347840	Right.
2347840	2351320	And, you know, you, it's interesting, I mean, you can try and you can do all sorts of stuff
2351320	2356440	and you know, but it turns out, I think one thing you can conclude and one way to interpret
2356440	2361320	the entirety of all the LMI stuff is to say, that's the wrong way to do it.
2361320	2362760	You don't do it sequentially.
2362760	2369200	The right way to do it is to co-design the policy or controller and the certificate or
2369200	2371040	proof of correctness.
2371040	2372040	You co-design them.
2372040	2378560	And in fact, an even cooler and more advanced view, which I think people probably knew this
2378560	2384760	in the 60s or 70s, is you design the proof of correctness first and then the controller
2384760	2386280	will fall out from it.
2386280	2387280	Right.
2387280	2391120	So if I produce a control Lyapunov function or an approximate, that's the idea behind
2391120	2393000	approximate dynamic programming.
2393000	2394000	Right.
2394000	2397400	And incredibly powerful idea, I think.
2397400	2403200	And I guess this is very much related to some of your most recent work on COCP.
2403200	2405040	Is that fair to say?
2405040	2406040	It is fair to say.
2406040	2407040	Yeah.
2407520	2412960	So COCP is Convex Optimization Control Policy.
2412960	2417760	And it's a broad term for a policy in sequential decision making.
2417760	2420200	Could be a controller, but it could also be a trading engine.
2420200	2422200	It could be all sorts of other stuff.
2422200	2423720	It could be an alarm system.
2423720	2428680	So I'm thinking of control in a very broad way here.
2428680	2432880	And it basically embeds a convex optimization problem that you solve.
2432880	2433880	Right.
2433880	2435680	And, you know, I mean, there's lots of examples of this.
2435680	2439920	I mean, in traditional control, you'd have MPC, which has been done, I think, since the
2439920	2440920	late 70s.
2440920	2443920	MPC and like chemical process control.
2443920	2448720	And it's really fascinating, right, that you actually, you solve this complicated problem
2448720	2451000	and then that tells you your current action.
2451000	2453360	And then 15 minutes later, you do it again.
2453360	2454360	It's cool.
2454360	2458840	For the audience, I should probably just add what it perhaps is MPC just for everybody
2458840	2460080	to be on the same page.
2460080	2464560	So model predictive control, it's just, I guess the main idea there is really to solve
2464640	2470680	an optimal control problem recursively, iteratively, and that turns out to be a very good idea
2470680	2471680	in practice.
2471680	2472680	Yeah.
2472680	2475280	This is the very, very short sales speech, I would say.
2475280	2476280	Yeah.
2476280	2478240	But you were saying something about convex optimization policies.
2478240	2483720	I find that concept quite interesting and in a way also revolutionary.
2483720	2490560	I was watching a keynote that you gave at L4DC in 2022, and there was a fantastic, controversial
2490560	2497440	statement there that goes like, tuned COCP, so convex optimization control policies, is
2497440	2501080	the PID controller of the 21st century.
2501080	2502080	Can you elaborate on this?
2502080	2503080	I can.
2503080	2509480	So this is one of the things that you come to appreciate in control, and it's a really
2509480	2512480	cool fact about our field, and I think we should accept it and embrace it.
2512480	2513520	I think it's really awesome.
2513520	2522440	It's this, is that incredibly simple sounding algorithms can be unbelievably effective in
2522440	2523440	practice.
2523440	2526680	You know, PID controller is one of them, right?
2526680	2532120	And it's very funny when you go to a fancy control thing and you'd be hearing a lot of
2532120	2537280	theory and some fancy new robust controller and stuff like that.
2537280	2540360	It's just kind of, it's good grounding to think every now and then about things like
2540360	2542820	PID controller, lead lag control.
2542820	2546620	So I thought your definition of MPC was very good.
2546620	2553460	I want to put it in maybe a less fancy way to say it, because I see it, actually, it's
2553460	2556220	used in many, many fields with different names, right?
2556220	2560940	So the way, at the highest level, I would say it goes like this, right?
2560940	2562340	You know, you want to take an action.
2562340	2563780	It's for sequential decision making.
2563780	2567100	So you know, you can act right now, and there's stuff that you know, and there's stuff you
2567100	2568100	don't know.
2568100	2570140	Like you don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future.
2570140	2573300	You probably have some idea, but you don't know exactly.
2573300	2577300	And so the first thing you do is you get a forecast.
2577300	2578300	And it's ridiculous.
2578300	2580820	It's a single forecast of what's going to happen in the future, right?
2580820	2587020	You say, this is the way I think energy prices and demand are going to be moving in the next
2587020	2588020	48 hours.
2588020	2589180	Like that's a prediction.
2589180	2591780	And someone says, wow, do you believe it?
2591780	2593780	And you're like, no, of course not.
2593780	2594780	It's just a forecast.
2594780	2596580	I mean, come on, right?
2596580	2598460	Okay, then you do this.
2598460	2599660	It sounds so naive.
2599660	2600660	It's unbelievable.
2600660	2601660	You then do the following.
2601660	2602660	You say, okay, well, guess what?
2602660	2606540	I'm going to create myself a plan of action, assuming my single forecast is completely
2606540	2607540	correct.
2607540	2609340	And you're like, that makes no sense.
2609340	2612220	It doesn't make, it's like, this is not going to work, right?
2612220	2613220	Okay.
2613220	2616300	And then you say, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a plan of action.
2616300	2619100	You take the first step in that plan of action.
2619100	2622100	And that's what I'm going to do today, or for this 15 minute period.
2622100	2623420	Then they say, well, what happens next 15?
2623420	2624420	Well, you see, I do the same thing.
2624420	2627060	I get updated forecasts, I replan.
2627060	2631220	And then, of course, there's a lot of theory around it, which is, frankly, a little bit
2631220	2632220	silly.
2632220	2636460	I mean, it is nice to know that it kind of works in some silly cases, right?
2636460	2642020	But I think the most important fact about it is something like PI and PID, when it's
2642020	2646580	done correctly, it works extremely well, thank you.
2646580	2647900	If you think about it, I mean, it's hilarious.
2647900	2652660	It's used in finance, where it's called multi-period trading or something, right?
2652660	2656860	And that's hilarious, because the entire point about finance is precisely that you do not
2656860	2657860	know the future.
2657860	2662420	You know, if I knew future returns, like, I mean, I don't know, I have friends who say
2662420	2666620	if you can get the sign right 52% of the time, you can make money, right?
2666620	2669380	So the point is, you very much don't know the future.
2669380	2673660	And yet, you know, in the right hands, there it is working in finance.
2673660	2677260	So I remember I talked to someone in supply chain.
2677260	2678260	This is how they do it.
2678260	2679260	This is what supply chain does.
2679260	2680900	I mean, of course it is, right?
2680900	2684860	You make forecasts of product demands, right?
2684860	2689500	And then you figure out, like, what stuff should you ship where and, you know, all that
2689500	2690500	kind of stuff.
2690500	2693660	And you're taking into account a lot of cool stuff, like, you know, the cost of trucking
2693660	2699100	things or transporting things from one place to another, the capacity in a warehouse, the
2699100	2701660	amount of labor you have available to do X, Y, or Z.
2701660	2704220	So it's, you know, very sophisticated.
2704220	2707700	But it's based entirely on forecasts, you know, a week, a month, or, you know, even
2707700	2710020	sometimes an hour out.
2710020	2713020	It does seem to be the most intuitive thing to do, actually.
2713020	2714020	It is.
2714020	2717940	And I remember I talked to someone who's an expert on supply chain stuff.
2717940	2724500	And I said, what do you call it when you make a forecast, then make a plan of action, pretending
2724500	2729180	that your forecast is correct, take the first step, and then repeat the whole thing one
2729180	2730820	time step later?
2730820	2734700	I said, you know, we, I said, we call, you know, I said, in my field, we call this, you
2734700	2739940	know, model predictive control, dynamic matrix control, you know, all, you know, receding
2739940	2740940	horizon control.
2740940	2742580	I said, we have lots of names for it.
2742580	2743580	What do you call it?
2743580	2744820	And he just looked, stared straight at me.
2744820	2747700	And he said, yeah, I said, like, what in supply chain?
2747700	2748700	I don't know that dialect.
2748700	2749700	What do you call it?
2749700	2754940	And he just looked at me and he said, we call that supply chain optimization.
2754940	2758300	The point, the point being, like, what else would you do, right?
2758300	2759980	Like, what else could you possibly?
2759980	2760980	So it was cool.
2760980	2766900	I also had a, had a hilarious conversation with a friend of mine who is a CFO of a company.
2766900	2769860	So we're just chit-chatting, you know, about what CFOs do.
2769860	2770860	And guess what they do?
2770860	2775980	He said, basically, by the time we finished talking, he said, that's 80% of my job.
2775980	2776980	That's what I do.
2776980	2779260	It's just, he said, he said, now I know the name for it.
2779260	2780260	It's MPC.
2780260	2781260	Yeah.
2781260	2782260	He said, look, here's what I do.
2782260	2787740	I get, I get multiple forecasts of, you know, demand for our product, costs, right?
2787740	2792260	I know we're opening a new facility in Austin next year, and that's going to cost X.
2792260	2796660	We forecast, you know, revenue, we forecast growth, you know, all sorts of stuff, like
2796660	2800180	many quarters out, like six, eight quarters out, right?
2800180	2802180	And he said, yeah, we don't believe those.
2802180	2804580	He said, in fact, we typically make three forecasts, right?
2804580	2810340	Kind of a median one, kind of a poor outcome, like, you know, low revenue and high expenses,
2810340	2811340	right?
2811340	2817300	And then, you know, when they sometimes label bliss, which is like a, you know, and yeah.
2817300	2819740	And then he said, we make a complete plan.
2819740	2821060	I present it to the board.
2821060	2822660	That's what we do.
2822660	2829580	And no one on the board believes that your revenue forecast four quarters out is going
2829580	2830580	to be right.
2830580	2831820	No one believes that.
2831820	2832820	No one.
2832820	2838400	So, but the cool part is everyone understands you do this plan, so you don't do something
2838400	2842120	now that's going to put you in a bad position in the future.
2842120	2845140	And that's really the essential idea.
2845140	2846140	That's crazy.
2846140	2851620	And it seems to apply to at any scale in a way, also like at a political scale, for example.
2851620	2852740	It does.
2852740	2854580	In many other domains.
2854580	2859020	But maybe just to go back to convex optimization control policies.
2859020	2864440	How do those relate to, let's say, MPC that we just discussed extensively and other things
2864440	2865740	that we mentioned before?
2865740	2871420	MPC, model predictive control, is simply an instance of a convex optimization control
2871420	2872420	policy.
2872420	2877060	It's a policy where you solve a problem to decide an action.
2877060	2879220	And in this case, you solve it over horizon.
2879220	2880220	There are a lot of others.
2880220	2886460	I mean, one is approximate dynamic programming is another classic example of that.
2886460	2890380	But there are lots of other things where, a lot of these things have parameters in them
2890380	2893060	that you can use to tune, right?
2893060	2896980	This is not at all unlike PID, where you have three parameters to tune.
2896980	2900020	You have a lot more than three parameters to tune in these things.
2900020	2901860	Actually, that's not true.
2901860	2906980	In some cases, you would have hyperparameters, and there might only be a few, right?
2906980	2912780	Like if you're doing finance, you might have a term hyperparameter that scales the risk
2912780	2919460	cost, or another hyperparameter that scales the transaction cost, right?
2919460	2925820	And as senior people in control told me decades ago, the right way to think of these parameters,
2925820	2931020	they were of course referring to like LQG, is they said, these are knobs that you turn
2931180	2932980	to make the controller do what you like.
2932980	2935660	And it's this identical principle here, right?
2935660	2940820	So people have made convex optimization control policies for a while.
2940820	2944700	It's growing, I think, or it appears to be.
2944700	2949260	Part of it is the relentless improvement in computers, right?
2949260	2953340	So that doesn't hurt us at all, I should say, right?
2953340	2954340	Everything's based on that.
2954340	2956340	But a lot of the tuning was done by hand.
2956340	2960940	And that's actually, if you've got three hyperparameters, why not, right?
2961860	2968340	What's interesting is even something like 10 or 20 or 30 hyperparameters is a case where
2968340	2973140	you can tune that policy to make it do what you want.
2973140	2978020	And so I think that's what a tuned COCP policy is.
2978020	2982220	And what's, I think, kind of exciting is not theoretical, because everyone knows about
2982220	2985820	all this and knows that this is the general program.
2985820	2991300	I think the most exciting part about it actually is the infrastructure and ecosystem being
2991300	2994700	built out to actually do this, right?
2994700	2996820	So we'll talk about that, I imagine.
2996820	2997820	We'll talk about CVXPi.
2997820	2998820	Definitely.
2998820	2999820	Definitely.
2999820	3000820	But to me, that's the most interesting part.
3000820	3005460	I mean, I'm just wondering, I'm going to put myself in the shoes of the audience.
3005460	3012900	And could we conceptualize COCPs as essentially parametric convex optimization programs in
3012980	3016340	the parameter being the control policy in a way?
3016340	3018740	Would that be fair to say?
3018740	3021300	Maybe not quite.
3021300	3026380	So there are two types of parameters in a convex optimization control policy.
3026380	3031700	One, it tells you the context, and that's typically like the state or the inputs.
3031700	3036140	Or if someone says, no, I changed my mind, here's your target over here, right?
3036140	3037620	That's one.
3037620	3042740	And the second are parameters that affect the policy.
3042740	3045020	Which you don't expect to change very often.
3045020	3046260	And as a matter of fact, in...
3046260	3049100	This would be the Qs and Rs, for example, in LQR.
3049100	3050100	You got it.
3050100	3051100	Exactly.
3051100	3055260	And to be honest with you, in most legitimate applications, you don't change those at all.
3055260	3058580	I mean, you know, whatever, except with a software update or whatever it is you want
3058580	3060860	to do, right?
3060860	3061860	That's the safe model.
3061860	3062860	So...
3062860	3063860	It sounds super interesting.
3063860	3069260	And I guess the ecosystem that you were referring to before has to do with the enormous amount
3069260	3073700	of software that you have produced, again, in your, I wouldn't even say double life,
3073700	3076500	but triple life or fourth life.
3076500	3081500	So your first endeavor in that direction, I guess, was CVX in 2008.
3081500	3082500	That's right.
3082500	3089020	But then it sparked into a whole, as you said, ecosystem of different types of frameworks.
3089020	3096660	So for example, CVX-Gen, CVX-Pi, you also have a Julia version as well, CVX-R, OSQP.
3097540	3100420	I'm pretty sure I didn't mention even half of them.
3100420	3101420	Is that right?
3101420	3102420	You're right.
3102420	3103420	You didn't.
3103420	3104420	It's okay, though.
3104420	3105420	It's fine.
3105420	3106420	I'm curious there.
3106420	3111780	I mean, I guess this is also the result of your interest in how to apply all the theoretical
3111780	3113700	concepts that you developed.
3113700	3120340	But also, the concept that I found most interesting there was the idea of disciplined programming,
3120340	3121340	convex programming.
3121340	3122340	Right.
3122340	3124860	Can you elaborate on what that concept means for our audience?
3124860	3125860	Oh, I can.
3126060	3131020	So, you know, I was going around being a pain in the ass to people about convex optimization,
3131020	3134620	both before the development of these tools and after.
3134620	3136380	And it would go like this.
3136380	3138820	I'd be all, I mean, I think about it now, it'd be awful.
3138820	3142900	Like I'd go somewhere and someone would say like, okay, here's my problem and I want to
3142900	3144340	do X, Y, and Z.
3144340	3145340	And I'd come up to them afterwards.
3145340	3146620	I'd say, hey, guess what?
3146620	3148620	Your problem's convex optimization problem.
3148620	3149620	And they'd say, so?
3149620	3151500	And I'd say, so it means we can solve it.
3151500	3153440	And they'd say, so how do I do that?
3153440	3156920	And the truth was, in those days, it's kind of a pain in the ass, right?
3156920	3159920	Because you have to, you know, write all, I said, well, you just get yourself a grad
3159920	3164680	student and, you know, have them write up all this horrible code and it's hard to debug
3164680	3167300	and translate it to some standard form.
3167300	3171480	Then you link it to some solver, whatever at the time, you know.
3171480	3173680	So it just wasn't that easy.
3173680	3177680	And I remember a lot of times, even when I had come up to someone and said, look, we
3177680	3179520	could just solve your problem.
3179520	3182520	A lot of those people just thought I was a crazy person, but that's another story.
3182600	3187240	But even the ones who said, yeah, I think you're right, it just, the barrier to entry
3187240	3189280	was just too high.
3189280	3194640	It just involved, you know, tons of coding and C and C++ to link something and all that
3194640	3196160	sort of stuff.
3196160	3202400	So the, you know, the idea behind discipline convex programming is, the short description
3202400	3203400	is this.
3203400	3210480	It is a system for basically normal people or relatively normal people to be able to
3210480	3216560	specify and then solve a wide, very wide variety of convex optimization problems.
3216560	3217560	Right?
3217560	3220600	So the contract is very simple.
3220600	3222160	It's this.
3222160	3230880	You the user will accept basically extreme, extreme limitations on what you can express.
3230880	3232200	Okay?
3232200	3235520	Here's what we pay you if you honor that contract.
3235520	3239800	Then what we will do is we will faithfully translate your problem to a standard form
3240120	3243720	problem and solve it globally and give you the solution.
3243720	3244720	Right?
3244720	3245720	That's the contract.
3245720	3251640	And, you know, it's actually, I mean, it's not too dissimilar from the question of trying
3251640	3254160	to verify a controller.
3254160	3259880	You might imagine that the right way to use convex optimization in the field would be
3259880	3262040	people just write their problem.
3262040	3266040	And then, you know, some computer would look at it and try to argue and figure out if it's
3266040	3267040	convex or not.
3267280	3270480	And it turns out that's actually a truly terrible idea.
3270480	3275040	The right way to do it is to say there's a very short language.
3275040	3278840	As a matter of fact, there's exactly one rule, which is crazy.
3278840	3279840	So there's just one rule.
3279840	3285080	And if you follow, if you faithfully follow this one rule, when you form your problem,
3285080	3289960	then we guarantee we can faithfully translate it and then it can be solved.
3289960	3294680	And, you know, it's very different from so-called nonlinear optimization, right?
3294680	3299080	Because in so-called nonlinear optimization, you can do anything you like.
3299080	3301300	Type in whatever you like.
3301300	3304320	But now then the solving it, the modeling is easy.
3304320	3306320	And now the solving is like an art.
3306320	3308240	And in fact, in most cases, you can't even do it.
3308240	3313880	Anyway, so the idea of DCP is we just say, here's a simple rule.
3313880	3316040	You follow this rule.
3316040	3317240	We solve your problem.
3317240	3318240	Period.
3318240	3322640	And, you know, so we built a bunch of software implementations of this.
3322640	3324000	And it's fun to watch it grow.
3324000	3326400	And it's very widely used.
3326400	3327800	It's kind of awesome.
3327800	3328800	It's incredible.
3328800	3332120	I myself was a user of many of these tools.
3332120	3336320	And I can definitely vouch for the fact that it's incredibly easy to use.
3336320	3340400	And that's perhaps where the success of these tools lies.
3340400	3345320	So I was wondering, how do you actually make somehow these frameworks?
3345320	3350880	I would imagine that it can be posed as programming language free, in a sense, because programming
3350880	3355720	keeps on changing, in the sense of programming languages keep on changing, they keep on
3355720	3357240	being updated.
3357240	3362040	But how does one actually remains robust, let's say, to these changes?
3362040	3365680	So, you know, what's interesting is this goes back to the stuff we talked about before,
3365680	3369600	which was the value in practice of theory, right?
3369600	3374060	That you could imagine just basically hacking something together that says, oh, if you see
3374060	3376000	min or max, do this, right?
3376000	3379320	If you see the square, the square root, do this transformation.
3379320	3382480	And the point is, a system like that, it would probably never work.
3382480	3385440	I mean, it might appear to work at some point, but it doesn't really.
3385440	3391520	So DCP, Discipline Convex Programming, is built from an extremely small mathematical
3391520	3392980	core, right?
3392980	3396720	And the result is that with high probability, it's actually correct.
3396720	3399280	Now what's interesting is implementing that core.
3399280	3400920	And by the way, CVX was not the first one.
3400920	3406400	I would say the first one was YALMIP, which was, you know, yet another LMI processor,
3406400	3407400	which preceded it.
3407480	3409200	It's very, very cool.
3409200	3412160	Anyway, you know, the basic idea is very simple.
3412160	3417000	When we first did this in like MATLAB, you know, quite a while ago, they had just barely
3417000	3421120	introduced object oriented things, and it didn't really work and wasn't consistent and
3421120	3422120	blah, blah, blah.
3422120	3424600	And so it was actually kind of a pain to implement it.
3424600	3427280	Of course, that was Michael Grant, who did that.
3427280	3433980	You know, so what's happened is, as languages get more and more sophisticated, it gets easier
3433980	3435240	and easier to solve.
3435240	3440000	In Julia, for example, you know, which has the advantage of being a relatively recently
3440000	3445560	developed language, the core of convex.jl, it's like 40, 50 lines.
3445560	3449680	And you're like, how could that be?
3449680	3455040	And the reason is that the language supports these very high level abstractions, right?
3455040	3457080	So to me, that's actually really cool.
3457080	3463040	The idea that, you know, you go back to like C and Fortran, and I don't know, you can do
3463040	3466760	things like, you know, multiply two numbers, you know, and then shove them back into this
3466760	3469120	memory location or something like that, right?
3469120	3476760	I mean, but what's amazing is the new languages support incredible abstraction.
3476760	3481320	That's awesome for people like us, who use math to do practical things, because it means
3481320	3487080	you can actually express like really complicated things, or things that would be complicated
3487080	3489600	in just a handful of lines of code.
3489600	3493080	And I'm curious about like the future trends that you actually foresee.
3493080	3498000	So for example, do you have any thoughts on the role of, say, AI in completing our own
3498000	3505440	programs or what is the next big thing in solving the next type of most expressive optimization
3505440	3506440	problem?
3506440	3507440	I don't know.
3507440	3508760	What are your thoughts on monitoring operators?
3508760	3512240	There are so many questions that I still have, it's incredible.
3512240	3520400	So first of all, things like, you know, a chat GPT is amazing, including the code generation
3520400	3521400	portion of it.
3521400	3524520	It's just, it's, it's actually amazing.
3524520	3526280	It's awe inspiring.
3526280	3532600	And it's super interesting, like, you know, we've played with it, and it's actually super,
3532600	3537320	what it does is it generates things that sound completely correct, and usually are completely
3537320	3538520	wrong.
3538520	3543880	So which, but it's actually, to me, it was even a little bit disturbing, because I usually,
3543880	3549360	you know, in looking at students work, I usually associate poor writing with being wrong, and
3549360	3551880	good writing with being right.
3551880	3557520	And here was very good writing, but the logic and math was just completely wrong.
3557520	3560000	So now, by the way, I don't mean that as a criticism.
3560000	3564800	It's just that, you know, when they were training this thing, and you know, that no one said
3564800	3570280	that you should have a very negative reward for asserting something that's false, right?
3570280	3573360	You know, so if it sticks to interpretations and things like that, it's great.
3573360	3577880	And I, my suspicion is within a year or two, we'll see systems, you know, large language
3577880	3584600	models that will actually do really well, and will generally speaking, not make false
3584600	3585600	arguments.
3585600	3587080	So I think it's just amazing.
3587080	3592520	It is definitely interesting also to imagine different types of uses of these tools, for
3592520	3595360	example, in other domains, like music, even.
3595360	3600000	One can imagine that we could use them for a sculpture, for example, we feed them a bunch
3600000	3604240	of images for 3D printers, and then they're going to create something totally new.
3604240	3606560	Yeah, I'm very fascinated as well.
3606560	3610580	And I'm curious, what's the role that you see there of optimization?
3610580	3612680	Because it's definitely there under the hood.
3612680	3617440	Well, certainly, it's entirely based on, you know, well, it's SGD, stochastic gradient
3617440	3622480	descent under the hood on, you know, 100 billion parameter models.
3622480	3624200	So but I know that's kind of a cheap thing.
3624200	3625200	We all know that.
3625200	3627080	We all know that that's how it works, right?
3627080	3630600	And that's not why it works, although it's a critical component of it.
3630600	3635900	So I think it'll be a very interesting, in a way, people were talking about, you know,
3635900	3640480	we build things like CVXPi, so that you can in 10 lines, you know, you'd take a little
3640480	3644720	bit of training and in 10 lines, you can describe and very sophisticated novel problems and
3644720	3646200	have it solved, right?
3646200	3654600	We have code generation tools, like CVXGen, or CVXPiGen, that's a newer version of CVXGen.
3654600	3659200	And then you'd say, okay, I like what I'm seeing in simulation, please generate me real
3659200	3662900	time code, I can dump onto my drone or whatever it is, right?
3662900	3668420	So I think it's cool to have these high level tools that will simplify a lot of what used
3668420	3671200	to be, you know, basically a lot of work.
3671200	3675480	So people I've, I mean, actually, my students and colleagues were thinking like, this would
3675480	3676480	be awesome.
3676480	3679280	Like, you just talk to this thing and say, here's what it looks like.
3679280	3683280	In fact, why don't you go fit a model to the dynamics?
3683280	3684280	And it would do it.
3684280	3687680	And then you'd say, okay, let's make a controller, show me some simulations with your controller.
3687680	3690720	And you go, no, no, no, no, I don't like it, it's too rough a ride.
3690720	3695960	And then it would, you know, add a term penalizing ride roughness, right?
3695960	3700400	And so I can imagine like crazy stuff that would be really cool.
3700400	3704880	And it would eventually just kick out, like real time code, you can run on your drone
3704880	3705880	or whatever it is, right?
3705880	3710000	I guess the interesting question then will become again, verification.
3710000	3715240	So how does one guarantee that whatever is produced is actually complying with some sort
3715240	3720880	of performance measure that we, the users specify?
3720880	3726400	And I wonder whether we should be content with probability one, or I'm not sure.
3726400	3727400	Yeah.
3727400	3732000	So I guess that's, I mean, I have a specific idea about how I think convex optimization
3732000	3734760	and for example, neural networks should play.
3734760	3737240	They both play incredibly important roles.
3737240	3740420	They both do some things super well, right?
3740420	3744360	And I can give you an example and I'll take an example from finance, right?
3744360	3747560	Here's something that is just idiotic and does not work.
3747560	3753240	Like train a neural network that goes directly from Twitter feeds to a trade list, literally
3753240	3755000	telling you what to buy and sell.
3755000	3756000	That's like idiotic.
3756000	3758240	Like, why would you do that, right?
3758240	3764680	The correct way to do it is take a neural network that basically takes in some like
3764680	3770200	very complicated data like Twitter feeds and all sorts of other stuff, and then predicts,
3770200	3774480	let's say one day and five day forward returns.
3774480	3777360	That's a perfect use of it.
3777360	3783680	That is then plugged in to a convex optimization solver that weighs the risk, the transaction
3783680	3788680	costs, the constraints, and then from those, it generates the trade list.
3788680	3792520	Nice thing about the convex optimization part is we know what it does.
3792520	3794400	It can't do anything crazy.
3794400	3796160	Whatever it does, it does for a reason.
3796160	3797800	We know how to make it robust.
3797800	3799760	We understand precisely what it does.
3799760	3805200	And in fact, it can be made so reliable that it just runs real time without any human intervention.
3805200	3811080	So you have the neural network making very sophisticated forecasts, ones that would be
3811400	3814880	very difficult to do using other methods.
3814880	3818040	And then that feeds into some, you know, MPC or something like that.
3818040	3822840	So to me, that seems like the right way for these two technologies to play together.
3822840	3828240	Maybe that is the future actually of the interplay of control with machine learning that is nowadays
3828240	3833880	the elephant in the room for us control theorists, because it seems to work so well in certain
3833880	3837000	domains that it's impossible to ignore it.
3837000	3838000	Absolutely.
3838000	3839000	Yeah.
3839120	3842280	I think maybe it's time to shift gears a little bit.
3842280	3848200	I was definitely struck by your IEEE Control Systems Award acceptance speech, which I believe
3848200	3851720	appeared on CSM, the Control Systems magazine.
3851720	3854600	And there there's a fantastic quote that I definitely have to read.
3854600	3856320	It goes as follows.
3856320	3858320	For me, teaching is research.
3858320	3859640	Teaching is storytelling.
3859640	3862360	And the story behind the research is important.
3862360	3867360	The story should be simple and compelling with substance and maybe a few subplots.
3867360	3871880	And it should bring people in, not keep people away, for example, by using some esoteric
3871880	3877320	field specific dialect or acronyms or assuming that the reader has fully absorbed all details
3877320	3879040	of the last few papers.
3879040	3880040	I think that's great.
3880040	3882520	And I'd like you to elaborate a bit on this.
3882520	3883520	Sure.
3883520	3885120	What are your thoughts on teaching?
3885120	3886120	Yeah.
3886120	3891240	So, I mean, I really don't distinguish very much between teaching and research in both
3891240	3892240	cases.
3892240	3895500	And again, it comes back to the, I guess, this training in math and this aesthetic that
3895620	3900580	what you want is intellectual economy, right?
3900580	3904460	So no one wants to hear somebody come in and say, oh, there's this method and that method.
3904460	3905460	And then you could do this.
3905460	3906460	And oh, is it Tuesday?
3906460	3907460	Okay.
3907460	3909620	We can tell you about, you know, reverse conjugate gradients and blah, blah.
3909620	3915020	It's like, you know, I think when you hear that, it tells me that this person is kind
3915020	3917020	of confused inside, right?
3917020	3919900	What you really want is to get it down to its essence.
3919900	3923380	And it's not, this is not easy work to try to figure out, you know, what are the three
3923380	3924380	concepts?
3924460	3927820	A lot of it involves intellectual triage.
3927820	3931900	You know, when you see all these fights about the curriculum, you know, in various fields,
3931900	3933900	like let's say EE for one, right?
3933900	3936980	And someone would say, well, we can't throw out that topic and we can't throw out that
3936980	3941380	topic because we taught it for a hundred years, but we have to teach these new topics.
3941380	3944420	So and then you, you end up with this kind of, you know, garbled thing.
3944420	3945420	So you really have to do the triage.
3945420	3950020	And the triage really means you're going to let some of that stuff just die anyway.
3950020	3957380	So I think once you have a very clear picture of a field or a problem, number one, then
3957380	3958380	you can teach it.
3958380	3959460	So that's the same thing, right?
3959460	3962860	You can actually look at a crowd of a couple of hundred people and explain it and have
3962860	3964820	them go, okay, yeah, I get it.
3964820	3967700	And actually it's a good thing if some of them said, really?
3967700	3969280	It's really that simple?
3969280	3971380	And then you look at them, you go, yep.
3971380	3975820	So I'm sorry to be the one to tell you it's, it really is that simple.
3975900	3981260	In this sense, do you have any advice to like, say, future instructors or future teachers
3981260	3982860	at any scale, I guess?
3982860	3983860	Yeah, I do.
3983860	3989420	I mean, for me, teaching is intensely intellectual, right?
3989420	3993940	I mean, there's a performance aspect to it, like, and that's also super important.
3993940	3996660	It has to, it actually has to do with control and feedback.
3996660	4003620	But actually designing a lecture or a course or something like that is actually intensely
4003620	4004620	intellectual, right?
4004620	4009060	What you really want is a clean story, right?
4009060	4013380	And maybe the details are complicated.
4013380	4016880	And in the right social setting, it's fine to go into the details, right?
4016880	4020820	If you're with five other people who are experts on that field and you want to talk about some
4020820	4025540	weird, you know, constraint qualification thing and compactness of the dual, you know,
4025540	4026540	by all means, please do it.
4026540	4029180	I mean, I'm assuming this is not in public, right?
4029180	4031820	So that should not be done in public.
4031820	4036300	But, you know, I think other than that, you have to figure out, like, what are the main
4036300	4039740	things you're saying, and then organize it.
4039740	4044420	And then it's actually, it's a whole lot easier to teach then, because you're teaching the
4044420	4045780	structure to the students.
4045780	4050100	You know, it all goes back to this aesthetic of simplicity, right?
4050100	4054100	I guess this is extremely well demonstrated, not only in the books that we mentioned before,
4054100	4059060	but also in one of your most recent books, Introduction to Apply Linear Algebra.
4059060	4062580	Of course, there will be a link in the description to all the books and publications that we
4062580	4065100	mentioned in the podcast.
4065100	4070060	There you really take another level of abstraction and you make a wonderful exercise for people
4070060	4073700	to digest and understand linear algebra.
4073700	4079340	For me, it was, I did read the book and it was extremely clear and very, very interesting
4079340	4083940	take also on it, because there were lots of applications coming in from all sorts of different
4083940	4085420	fields.
4085420	4087980	Was that your goal in writing the book?
4087980	4089660	Yes, that's right.
4089660	4090780	It was a fun book to write.
4090780	4095260	I mean, it came about because, you know, I don't know, about five, ten years ago, maybe
4095260	4099620	ten years ago, I have a colleague and I was just complaining to him always about how terrible
4099620	4104140	the linear algebra teaching is and how people really, I mean, you don't even really, it's
4104140	4108940	much more important than knowing, for example, you know, calculus and all this kind of stuff.
4108940	4109940	So I kept complaining.
4109940	4115900	And at one point he turns to me at lunch and he says, look, you can either continue to
4115900	4119540	the end of your life complaining about linear algebra education, he said, or you can do
4119540	4120540	something about it.
4120540	4122540	And I was like, yeah, okay.
4122540	4124780	And at that moment, he got me.
4124780	4127740	So it was actually really fun.
4127740	4132620	And it's actually, so the book, I mean, I like to think of it, you know, basically it's
4132620	4137580	an extremely elementary, very slow introduction to linear algebra.
4137580	4139540	It's all sorts of stuff we don't do.
4139540	4142260	Like people say, you don't do SVD and you're like, that's right.
4142260	4143260	We don't.
4143300	4147180	You don't do the determinant, rank, range, null space, fundamental theorem of linear
4147180	4148180	algebra.
4148180	4149900	I was like, nope, nope, not a one.
4149900	4155340	So we, it just focuses around basically least squares and what you can do with it.
4155340	4159620	And you shouldn't make fun of that because, you know, a very large fraction of entire
4159620	4164180	industries are run on methods that, you know, are glorified forms of least squares and control
4164180	4166900	is one of them, to be perfectly honest.
4166900	4172420	So I think of it as like, you know, the slow eating movement, you know, this is where you
4172420	4177100	don't run in and grab something, you know, you have a two or three hour, you know, lunch
4177100	4181420	and a four hour dinner and you, you actually savor each course, right?
4181420	4185780	So this is basically the slow linear algebra approach, right?
4185780	4188620	I guess there's also like a basic philosophy behind it.
4188620	4194020	So how many people do you want to draw in with respect to say, I want to say something
4194020	4195440	to a selected few.
4195440	4196580	That is precisely right.
4196580	4200580	So we call certain courses outreach courses.
4200620	4205100	And first I'll tell you what, here's not an outreach course, a course on the most advanced
4205100	4210580	topics in information theory, you know, the seven papers published in the last year.
4210580	4211580	Okay.
4211580	4212660	That's a perfectly good course.
4212660	4217140	It's a great course, you know, and you've got your four students in it and it's great.
4217140	4218140	Okay.
4218140	4219140	The opposite is an outreach course.
4219140	4225580	And the idea there is to design a course that brings the essence of the ideas to an incredibly
4225580	4229900	wide group, people in many different departments and fields.
4229900	4232460	And there you really have to do the intellectual triage, right?
4232460	4233940	You can't tell them everything.
4233940	4238300	So you really have to kind of think about what are the useful ideas and what are the
4238300	4240500	useful methods, right?
4240500	4241820	And so it's part of that.
4241820	4246820	And so it was a really fun exercise, you know, for me and Lieven, my coauthor to do.
4246820	4247820	Yeah.
4247820	4252820	I guess also accessibility is a concept that is very much at the heart of your endeavor.
4252820	4257180	This is also reflected by the fact that everything that you produce is open source.
4257180	4258180	Is that right?
4258180	4259180	That's right.
4259460	4263020	And you're potentially, well, one of the few that I have in mind that has all of his own
4263020	4267140	papers on his website are publicly available, including books.
4267140	4272660	And I'm just curious, what is it that motivates you to go in the direction of open source?
4272660	4278140	Well, I think it's extremely important to advancing, I mean, this is good for everyone
4278140	4280980	is to make all this material available.
4280980	4284540	I think it, you know, it advances science and advances research.
4284540	4291260	And I have gone to places, you know, where I would give a talk and I would have people
4291260	4295540	come up to me, you know, afterwards and say something like, you know, we want to especially
4295540	4298980	thank you for putting your convex optimization book online.
4298980	4305460	And they said, because we can buy it, but the price is about two months salary, right?
4305460	4308260	And so, you know, I didn't think this through carefully.
4308260	4312340	I would love to revise history and claim that I thought this through and it was a moral
4312340	4317300	decision and a, you know, rational anyway, honestly, we just fumbled into it.
4317300	4320060	But I am also very happy that that's the way I've done it.
4320060	4324340	I guess another interesting segue to this is related to publishing.
4324340	4330140	So I would be curious to hear your view about what are the right incentives in that direction
4330140	4335060	on modern publishing, let's say, and I'm curious about what are your thoughts on the social
4335060	4337500	aspect behind science as well?
4337500	4338500	Right.
4338500	4341180	There's a couple of different aspects of that question.
4341180	4349460	I mean, one is that there are these predatory publishing companies, you know, that basically
4349460	4354940	get essentially for free material from researchers and professors and, you know, this kind of
4354940	4361100	thing actually then have it reviewed for free by other professors and researchers, right?
4361100	4365440	I mean, even now the production costs are approximately zero.
4365440	4369980	Then they create these things and then price them at appalling prices, knowing that there
4370820	4376660	is some inelastic demand, like, you know, various libraries are going to get a copy.
4376660	4381940	And then in addition, I mean, this restricts the free flow of this information.
4381940	4384580	So I think, you know, that's a very bad phenomenon.
4384580	4388460	It's not going away fast enough for my taste, but I hope it does.
4388460	4391460	Now there are some really good publishers, right?
4391460	4397820	Cambridge University Press is mine and I just think they are awesome in every way.
4397900	4401660	I mean, you know, they do a lot and they add a lot.
4401660	4404380	So I think that's one aspect, the problem with it.
4404380	4406980	By the way, it's not always the for-profit publishers, right?
4406980	4413220	There are nonprofit publishers that are basically not doing good stuff for science, right?
4413220	4417100	I'm not going to name any, but there are some and, you know, they're not, okay, they're
4417100	4418100	not in control.
4418100	4423460	You know, like IEEE or something like that is on the ethical scale of publishing.
4423460	4425620	You know, they're on the positive side.
4425620	4426620	I think that's one aspect.
4426620	4430740	I think the other aspect is that now that we have the ability to make stuff so widely
4430740	4434980	available, I think it's a great idea to do it.
4434980	4439060	And I heard a talk at Stanford about this, about the effects, it was a talk in history
4439060	4444020	about the effects of the GI Bill, the General Infantry Bill.
4444020	4447140	So after World War II, there were a lot of returning soldiers in the U.S.
4447140	4450380	They didn't know what to do with them, so they sent them to college.
4450380	4452180	And this was absolutely radical, right?
4452180	4454620	Before that time, you didn't send them to college, right?
4454620	4459100	It was like, that was for people who were rich or something like that, right?
4459100	4464100	And you know, lo and behold, it turns out that all those people who would not have gone
4464100	4469540	to college, some of them were really, really smart, right?
4469540	4473220	So she went on to name how a lot of these people went on to win Nobel prizes and things
4473220	4474220	like that.
4474220	4477180	I mean, that's not a good end in itself, but still, I think it's that, right?
4477180	4482620	If you, you know, if you find some place where people don't have a lot of opportunities for
4482620	4487580	a wide variety of reasons, the idea that they can, I don't know, I love the idea that
4487580	4494260	somebody could be, right as we speak right now, I'm hoping some kids in various places
4494260	4495900	are reading the Linear Algebra book.
4495900	4497540	I just think that's awesome.
4497540	4499180	And it's not just a cool thing to do.
4499180	4501620	I think actually there'll be some really good benefits.
4501620	4504980	Some of those people are going to grow up to do really great stuff.
4504980	4509940	And hopefully they will listen also to this episode as well, and they'll be inspired.
4509940	4512300	I hope so, yeah.
4512300	4517300	So we're heading towards the end of this episode and in closing, I would like to ask you maybe
4517300	4523260	a couple of questions related to the future of convex optimization and control, or maybe
4523260	4525660	the intersection of both.
4525660	4530660	And maybe I'll have another question related to advice that I tend to ask to any guest
4530660	4536220	that features on the show to future students, future students that happen to be in control
4536220	4539580	nowadays or planning to come in the field.
4539580	4542180	What would be your best advice in general?
4542180	4543180	Yeah.
4543180	4544180	So let's see.
4544180	4546860	So the first question is about the future and like what's going on.
4546860	4552140	And I have to say that, you know, what I'm focusing on is actually pretty pedestrian,
4552140	4553140	but I think it's important.
4553140	4557340	So my focus and a lot of what our group does, I mean, we do fun stuff too, but a lot of
4557340	4563300	it is just to make sure that we build out the infrastructure that we need for very wide
4563300	4567260	groups of people to use these methods, right?
4567260	4568260	That's what we want to do.
4568260	4572180	So if you look at some other fields, they have done so well at this.
4572180	4576220	I mean, machine learning, unbelievable.
4576220	4581980	The amount of open source material that's available and incredibly high quality open
4581980	4583700	source implementations of things.
4583700	4587420	I mean, it's, I mean, anyway, my hat goes off to them.
4587420	4589180	I mean, I think they've done a spectacular job.
4589180	4594020	I personally think in optimization, we've done a less good job and in control, maybe
4594020	4595700	even worse than that.
4595700	4598100	So and a lot of it is kind of pedestrian and boring.
4598100	4602700	Like, you know, everybody knows how to implement a, you know, whatever, you know, a QP solver,
4602700	4606620	but you know, somebody has got to make one that's open source and reliable and works
4606620	4607620	and things like that.
4607620	4609220	So we do a lot of that stuff.
4609220	4613980	When you say these words, you have in mind things like TensorFlow, PyTorch or those kind
4613980	4614980	of things.
4614980	4615980	Yeah.
4615980	4616980	Oh my God.
4616980	4617980	That's so good.
4617980	4620380	I mean, you know, I think they've just done an incredibly good job.
4620380	4624420	And, you know, if you think about it, there's nothing like that in control.
4624420	4628980	Name the open source tools in control that people could use, right?
4628980	4630580	I mean, it's a simple question.
4630580	4633500	Like, I sit down with someone, I tell them what control is for like five minutes and
4633500	4635340	they go, this is awesome.
4635340	4636340	This is awesome.
4636340	4638740	I want to use this so-called control.
4638740	4640780	Like, how do I do it?
4640780	4641780	Right?
4641780	4644460	Like, tell me, you know, what Git repo do I clone?
4644460	4647140	Or, you know, what do I need to pip install?
4647140	4648140	Right?
4648140	4650500	And the answer is, there's like nothing.
4650500	4654340	I mean, there's commercial stuff, you know, which, you know, there's for profit stuff.
4655260	4657100	So, I mean, it's a little embarrassing for all feel and I'll be honest, I think it's
4657100	4658100	a little embarrassing.
4658100	4660780	And then you asked about advice.
4660780	4664020	And I would say to a student, and this is going to be very personal because it's what
4664020	4668380	I thought I wish someone had told me, you know, maybe it's also a character flaw on
4668380	4669380	my part.
4669380	4673380	But, you know, when I was young, I was very snobby and had very high standards and things
4673380	4675460	like that.
4675460	4679620	And I kind of avoided things that were messy and, you know, a lot of the applied stuff
4679620	4681620	was messy and stuff like that.
4682340	4687540	And it was only much later that I realized how rich an experience you can have when you
4687540	4692020	learn all the math, but you also learn a lot about, you know, how it's applied and how
4692020	4694380	does this field work and how does that field work.
4694380	4700180	So, my advice to young people is, you know, absolutely focus on the basics.
4700180	4701300	Absolutely do that.
4701300	4706220	But also, you know, spend a little quality time as you, I think you used the word traveling.
4706220	4708820	So, doing some intellectual traveling.
4709420	4713060	Go, just, you know, go over to the mountain to the next village and see what they're up
4713060	4714060	to.
4714060	4717980	You know, maybe if you only go one village, they'll speak a similar dialect, you can figure
4717980	4718980	out what they're doing.
4718980	4723900	And because I just think that's so enriching, you know, when you come back to know how people
4723900	4726700	in different fields use math.
4726700	4728220	I think it's super interesting.
4728220	4729860	That would be my advice.
4729860	4733820	What do you think is the best way to make this happen in a way?
4733820	4739220	Because it's something that I tend to observe in many, many students nowadays, the, the,
4739220	4743460	there is definitely this tension towards, you know, learning theory, hardcore theory
4743460	4747260	and becoming always more and more knowledgeable about that.
4747260	4748260	Right.
4748260	4751340	And in that way, you detach yourself from applications.
4751340	4755420	I think you're right that I think in some ways, some of the incentives in academia just
4755420	4756420	aren't right.
4756420	4761740	That, you know, the incentive is to write an eight page paper that is completely impenetrable,
4761740	4766540	that no one understands and so on, and, you know, is poorly written, which is actually,
4766540	4772060	it's obfuscated, maybe not intentionally, but so I think a lot of the incentives are
4772060	4774940	towards that, but I think that's the wrong incentive.
4774940	4781180	So I would, my advice would be to do something your advisor sometimes will not be on board
4781180	4782180	with.
4782180	4785280	And, and that is, you know, poke around, look at other things, right?
4785280	4790600	Take the time to write things that are clear and simple, make some open source implementations
4790600	4793880	of various things and just literally just contribute it to the world.
4793880	4795960	That'd be one of my pieces of advice.
4795960	4799720	The other thing is just hang out and talk to other people in other fields and try to
4799720	4804360	hold back on judgment until you've begun to understand their dialect.
4804360	4806560	I wish someone had given me that advice.
4806560	4808400	I think this is great advice.
4808400	4811220	Well, Steven, thanks a lot for your time.
4811220	4814040	It's been a wonderful journey to chat with you.
4814040	4815760	Thanks for accepting our invitation.
4815760	4817400	Oh, thank you so much, Alberto.
4817400	4820320	I think this is a great idea and I hope it's going to do a lot of good.
4820320	4821320	It's awesome.
4821320	4822320	Thank you for listening.
