Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

00:10.480 --> 00:23.000
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.600
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.840
Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Centre of Competence in Research of Dependable Ubiquitous

00:30.840 --> 00:35.120
Automation and the International Federation of Automatic Control.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.560
Our guest today is Mustafa Kammasch, Professor of Control Theory and Systems Biology in the

00:39.560 --> 00:44.320
Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.840
Welcome to the show, Mustafa.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.120
Glad to be here.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.200
Thanks for having me at your podcast, Alberto.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.520
Mustafa, let's jump right into it.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.800
What is cyber genetics?

00:55.800 --> 01:03.320
Cyber genetics is actually a portmanteau of two words, cybernetics and genetics.

01:03.320 --> 01:09.160
And it's a term I came up with a few years ago because I got tired of saying all the

01:09.160 --> 01:14.680
time research at the interface of systems and control theory and genetic engineering.

01:14.680 --> 01:20.560
So it just seems much more fun and much more compact to just say cyber genetics.

01:20.560 --> 01:26.960
So essentially it is just that, it's a fusion of cybernetics, which is the term coined by

01:26.960 --> 01:35.320
Norbert Wiener in 1948, which aims to study control and communication in the human and

01:35.320 --> 01:39.880
in the machine under the same umbrella.

01:39.880 --> 01:44.680
And it has a more modern feature, which is the genetics part.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.480
As you see, at the time of Norbert Wiener, 1948, the structure of DNA hasn't even been

01:50.480 --> 01:52.280
discovered yet.

01:52.280 --> 01:59.600
And so much of the work that went on in cybernetics had more to do with things like neuroscience,

01:59.600 --> 02:05.860
maybe diseases that had to do with neuromuscular sources.

02:05.860 --> 02:08.240
But nowadays we have much more powerful tools.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.340
We have much more powerful genetic tools and we could do so much more.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.960
And so you can imagine now we can bring this cybernetics to a new level.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.820
So that's what I mean when I say cyber genetics.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.300
Yeah, that's a fantastic definition.

02:23.300 --> 02:27.060
I might ask, what is a gene actually?

02:27.060 --> 02:28.220
What do we mean by that?

02:28.220 --> 02:30.780
And what do we mean by genetics?

02:30.780 --> 02:32.860
What are the goals there?

02:32.860 --> 02:38.540
Yeah, I think a gene is essentially the basic hereditary units.

02:39.260 --> 02:45.480
You know, very simply, you can think of a gene as corresponding to a single protein.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.660
It's not exactly like that.

02:46.660 --> 02:50.820
It's not always like that, but I think this is good enough.

02:50.820 --> 02:58.340
And so each gene is a stretch of DNA encoded using nucleotides on DNA.

02:58.340 --> 03:03.240
And when that stretch is expressed, the outcome is a single protein.

03:03.240 --> 03:08.880
This protein goes on to interact with other proteins or maybe with other genes to implement

03:08.880 --> 03:10.880
various different functions.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.120
I guess there it would be useful to have a small primer on how biology works and how

03:16.120 --> 03:19.680
DNA is used in biology or in biological systems.

03:19.680 --> 03:23.900
Yeah, so of course DNA is central to life.

03:23.900 --> 03:29.840
In its sequences are encoded, you know, all the biological functions that the organism

03:29.840 --> 03:31.840
requires.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.480
It's extremely dense with information.

03:36.480 --> 03:42.620
And so you can think about DNA as encoding all the information needed for the biological

03:42.620 --> 03:45.140
processes required for life.

03:45.140 --> 03:49.700
But it's not only a storage device, because DNA itself is a molecule and it interacts

03:49.700 --> 03:57.960
with other proteins through which this interaction regulates the amount of gene expression.

03:57.960 --> 04:03.000
So gene expression is a term that comes up repeatedly, and you mentioned something about

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.040
So it consists of two different processes.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.700
The first one is transcription, and the second one is translation.

04:10.700 --> 04:17.400
So transcription is the process by which the DNA is read inside the cell.

04:17.400 --> 04:23.060
And the outcome of this transcription process is messenger RNA.

04:23.060 --> 04:31.540
So you have a messenger RNA that then goes on to be translated by cellular machines called

04:31.540 --> 04:38.900
ribosomes, and the outcome of that process, of that translation process, is these proteins.

04:38.900 --> 04:46.500
Usually you have a sequence of amino acids that then folds into a secondary structure

04:46.500 --> 04:52.340
or a tertiary structure, and once it's fully folded, then it's called a protein, and that's

04:52.340 --> 04:53.340
when it's functional.

04:53.340 --> 04:57.740
And by functional, I mean, you know, it can interact with other proteins, with other RNAs,

04:57.740 --> 05:03.820
with other genes, to do all the wonderful things that the cell has to do to exist.

05:03.820 --> 05:09.260
I guess that maybe at this point already, someone in the audience will think, am I listening

05:09.260 --> 05:11.620
to the right podcast?

05:11.620 --> 05:14.940
But you mentioned so many words that come from engineering.

05:14.940 --> 05:21.460
So you mentioned regulation, you mentioned machines, you literally called ribosomes machines,

05:21.620 --> 05:25.940
you mentioned interaction, which is so key in our field.

05:25.940 --> 05:31.300
So what is the role of control theory here, and what does it have to do with biology?

05:32.740 --> 05:36.420
Actually, control is very native to biology.

05:36.420 --> 05:43.940
In fact, biological systems discovered control billions of years before we did,

05:44.580 --> 05:49.380
and they have been employing it in different flavors, different levels of organization,

05:50.100 --> 05:52.100
much longer than we have.

05:53.060 --> 05:59.700
And so it's not really an exaggeration to say that much of the complexity of biological

05:59.700 --> 06:02.980
systems have to do with the requirements of regulation.

06:03.540 --> 06:08.180
And that's because regulation, or what biologists call regulation, what we also call control,

06:09.300 --> 06:16.100
exists at every level of organization in biology, from the molecular level, to the cellular level,

06:16.100 --> 06:19.860
to the tissue level, to the organism level, even to the ecological level.

06:20.500 --> 06:26.740
And so if you look at the typical biological systems, you will very quickly find tons and

06:26.740 --> 06:32.420
tons of feedback loops, feedforward loops that are helping the cells achieve their various

06:32.420 --> 06:35.060
functions in a very robust fashion.

06:35.060 --> 06:42.100
So really, it's quite natural to be doing control in biology, because as I said, much

06:42.100 --> 06:45.380
of the complexity of biology is about regulation.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.620
Or comes from this regulation.

06:48.900 --> 06:49.220
Yeah.

06:49.220 --> 06:54.260
And I was actually looking at your biography, you know, in doing my homework for this podcast,

06:54.260 --> 06:59.780
and you're natively a control theorist, but you then moved, ventured, if you want, in

06:59.780 --> 07:00.260
this field.

07:00.820 --> 07:05.220
And so I was wondering what has drawn your attention from being a very theoretical person

07:05.220 --> 07:12.100
who was working into deep questions in robust control towards this fascinating field?

07:13.220 --> 07:14.580
Yeah, that's a very good question.

07:14.580 --> 07:19.700
Actually, thinking back at those times, this was in the late 90s.

07:21.060 --> 07:26.980
So I was working on robust control for my PhD thesis, and the early and mid into the

07:26.980 --> 07:29.700
late 90s, I was still working on robust control.

07:29.700 --> 07:34.020
But by that time, really, the main problems in robust control have been solved.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.740
So the H-infinity problems, state space solutions, Turicati equation problem has been solved.

07:39.460 --> 07:44.260
And there wasn't much left in terms of, you know, big problems.

07:45.060 --> 07:50.100
And at the same time, around the same time, my wife had our second child.

07:50.100 --> 07:55.620
And after childbirth, she had the problems with her thyroid gland.

07:55.620 --> 08:00.340
So she was going through a period of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

08:00.340 --> 08:06.180
So the thyroid hormones were essentially oscillating like crazy.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.900
And I had no idea what was going on.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.780
So I went to the library and I picked up a textbook on endocrinology.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.420
Endocrinology is a science of hormones and their actions.

08:17.220 --> 08:22.740
And really, this was a very transformative moment because I was shocked by what I was

08:22.740 --> 08:23.620
reading.

08:23.620 --> 08:30.580
Everything in that book seemed like it's a control theory without equations, right?

08:30.580 --> 08:36.340
So there's one exquisite feedback loop after the other, doing all kinds of different things,

08:36.980 --> 08:38.340
but of course, no equations.

08:38.340 --> 08:40.020
So I was really fascinated by this.

08:40.020 --> 08:46.100
And that led me to go to the National Animal Disease Center at Iowa State University, where

08:46.100 --> 08:47.620
I was at the time in the US.

08:48.260 --> 08:52.420
And I talked to one of the physiologists and I said, you know, I'm a control theorist.

08:52.420 --> 08:56.180
Please, can you give me a problem where you think control theory could be useful?

08:56.180 --> 09:00.180
And it was very naive, but actually, it turned out he gave me a fantastic problem.

09:01.060 --> 09:09.140
He gave me a problem that he was working on that had to do with how mammals, in his particular

09:09.140 --> 09:12.660
case, dairy cows, regulate their blood calcium.

09:14.100 --> 09:22.100
So us humans and other mammals, we have a very tight regulation of calcium in the blood

09:22.100 --> 09:22.580
plasma.

09:22.580 --> 09:27.140
This is important because calcium ions are needed for muscle function, nerve function,

09:27.140 --> 09:29.300
blood clotting, signal communications, and so on.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.580
So it's a very important biochemical role.

09:32.580 --> 09:40.020
And because of that, we have evolved a very elaborate control system to maintain the

09:40.020 --> 09:43.700
concentration at about 9 milligrams per deciliter.

09:43.700 --> 09:48.500
So it's really a fascinating problem, and it could have been a better problem to start

09:48.500 --> 09:48.740
with.

09:49.460 --> 09:55.460
In that case, they were looking at a specific disease that dairy cows had that humans don't

09:55.460 --> 09:56.100
usually have.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.220
It's called milk fever.

09:58.180 --> 10:03.220
And it turned out to be some kind of a dynamic instability in the closed-loop system that

10:03.220 --> 10:08.580
was induced by the way humans breed cows to make more and more and more milk.

10:09.460 --> 10:16.660
And so myself and another young master's students that I had, we had a lot of fun

10:16.660 --> 10:17.860
working out the details.

10:18.660 --> 10:24.340
And when all the dust settled, we had discovered that mammals regulate their blood calcium

10:25.300 --> 10:27.700
by using proportional integral feedback.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.820
It's as simple as that.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.500
So that was kind of a nice discovery.

10:33.060 --> 10:37.300
All the ingredients and the elements were there in terms of the main players, the hormones

10:37.300 --> 10:38.260
and their interactions.

10:39.140 --> 10:45.460
It just waited for somebody with a control perspective to explain what these interactions

10:45.460 --> 10:46.580
were actually doing.

10:46.580 --> 10:51.780
Well, you probably didn't have any mathematical model for studying this phenomenon, or was

10:51.780 --> 10:53.140
there actually any?

10:53.140 --> 10:54.900
Did you have to develop everything from scratch?

10:55.700 --> 11:01.460
We didn't have any mathematical model, but we developed a very, very simple model, actually.

11:02.180 --> 11:07.220
Just looking at the blood volume as a constant volume and looking at various sources for

11:07.220 --> 11:12.580
calciums and various sinks, and then making simple arguments like, you know, disturbance

11:12.580 --> 11:14.660
looks like an outflux of calcium.

11:14.660 --> 11:19.780
And then we know the system regulates with zero steady-state tracking error, so the

11:19.780 --> 11:22.100
controller must have such and such properties.

11:22.740 --> 11:26.900
And so the model we used actually was very simple, maybe a second-order model.

11:26.900 --> 11:32.500
Only when we were looking at the specific disease did we have to go to more complicated

11:32.500 --> 11:33.300
nonlinearities.

11:33.300 --> 11:38.100
And even then, there were saturation-type nonlinearities, which were very naturally

11:38.900 --> 11:43.780
justified based on the nature of the disease that we were working with.

11:43.780 --> 11:48.420
So basically, third-order linear systems with saturation nonlinearities.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.100
That was sufficient to explain the whole story.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.500
Of course, one can develop more complicated models with different compartments and so

11:54.500 --> 11:59.060
on, but I think for the purposes that we needed it, this was sufficient.

11:59.060 --> 12:00.180
And the essence was there.

12:00.900 --> 12:06.820
And so that was your, let's say, initial start in this world of systems and synthetic

12:06.820 --> 12:07.220
biology.

12:07.220 --> 12:11.700
Actually, may I ask, what is the difference between the two fields, between synthetic

12:11.700 --> 12:13.140
biology and systems biology?

12:13.860 --> 12:14.900
That's a very good question.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.220
I get asked this question a lot.

12:17.940 --> 12:25.460
I think, you know, one analogy would be it's similar to the difference between system theory

12:25.460 --> 12:26.420
and control theory.

12:27.780 --> 12:35.620
So systems biology aims to analyze existing biological networks, and it's some kind of

12:36.260 --> 12:38.100
reverse engineering, if you will.

12:38.100 --> 12:42.740
So you have a network that's functional, you have a cell that's doing a certain thing,

12:42.740 --> 12:45.300
you're trying to understand why it does what it does.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.260
And when it fails, why it fails.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.620
And so you kind of ask questions about a network that already exists.

12:52.340 --> 12:56.660
Now, synthetic biology does things a little bit differently.

12:56.660 --> 12:58.660
So it's more like a forward engineering.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.340
How can we modify this network?

13:02.340 --> 13:10.100
How can we add additional components so that it either achieves new function or it fixes

13:10.100 --> 13:12.660
the function that somehow was broken, right?

13:12.660 --> 13:18.580
So if there's a disease and then you add a new element into your cells to kind of cure

13:18.580 --> 13:22.340
that disease, this would be more on the forward engineering part.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.340
So I think that's really the main difference.

13:25.140 --> 13:29.540
It's like adding the synthesis aspect to a systems biology.

13:30.180 --> 13:35.060
In our language, the former would be analysis, dealing with analysis, and the second would

13:35.060 --> 13:36.100
be dealing with design.

13:37.220 --> 13:39.620
So they go hand in hand, they're complementary.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.260
That's a very good way of saying it.

13:42.340 --> 13:45.300
Also, synthetic biology can be used for analysis.

13:45.300 --> 13:51.380
So for example, let's say you have a hypothesis about a biological system, you think it works

13:51.380 --> 13:55.140
in a certain way, and then you go build it in the lab.

13:55.140 --> 13:58.740
And if it doesn't function the way it's supposed to function, then you have to adjust

13:58.740 --> 13:59.620
your understanding.

14:00.500 --> 14:08.020
And so one can also think of synthetic biology as sort of a field that allows you to tinker

14:08.020 --> 14:14.020
and get a deeper understanding of the underlying science, not only just to build new things.

14:14.020 --> 14:18.660
And this is reminiscent of another Feynman quote, building his understanding that appeared

14:18.660 --> 14:20.020
on this podcast before.

14:20.020 --> 14:20.500
Yeah.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
What I cannot build, I do not understand.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.700
Exactly, exactly.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.260
Exactly, yeah.

14:24.260 --> 14:30.420
That's an often quoted quote by Richard Feynman, a synthetic biologist.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.060
Yeah.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.700
I think it captures the essence quite well.

14:34.180 --> 14:39.860
Actually, yeah, I was looking at the history of synthetic biology, and it seems to be extremely

14:39.860 --> 14:45.620
recent, at least, you know, the year 2000 seems to be the turning point in this field.

14:45.620 --> 14:50.980
Of course, there are predecessors, but in 2000, there were, I believe, three really

14:50.980 --> 14:57.860
milestone papers on nature where people actually implemented biological circuits that essentially

14:57.860 --> 14:59.220
implemented a switch.

14:59.220 --> 15:04.820
Another one would implement an oscillator, and another circuit would implement a feedback

15:04.820 --> 15:05.860
mechanism, essentially.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.060
So all three in the same year.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.180
It's incredible.

15:08.180 --> 15:08.820
That's right.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.020
Even in the same journal.

15:12.260 --> 15:12.900
Exactly right.

15:12.900 --> 15:17.540
So there were three milestone papers that essentially demonstrated what you said.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.420
One can think of these circuits in the following way.

15:21.060 --> 15:25.220
One of them used one gene, and the second one used two genes, and the third one used

15:25.220 --> 15:27.300
three genes, and they all had negative feedback.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.900
So when you have negative feedback with one gene, you have an auto-regulatory circuit,

15:30.900 --> 15:33.700
so that's the usual feedback systems that we like.

15:34.340 --> 15:39.300
When you have two genes, each having negative feedback on each other, you have positive

15:39.300 --> 15:43.780
feedback, and that's what implements, by stability in this case, a toggle switch.

15:44.580 --> 15:50.180
And the third had, you know, three genes, each repressing the other in a sort of a

15:50.180 --> 15:51.860
ring-type fashion.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.460
So then you get a ring oscillator.

15:54.180 --> 15:57.060
And yeah, that's a work of Michael Elowitz.

15:57.380 --> 16:02.260
Those are the three classic papers that kicked the field into motion.

16:02.260 --> 16:08.900
And in fact, the tools of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, the most important tool,

16:08.900 --> 16:14.900
they were already available in the 70s and 80s, and many biologists actually have done

16:14.900 --> 16:16.020
synthetic constructs.

16:16.020 --> 16:22.820
But I think in the year 2000, people were thinking of this field more like VLSI circuit

16:22.820 --> 16:23.460
design, right?

16:23.460 --> 16:30.660
So you can build circuits and devices that then you can put together into functional

16:30.660 --> 16:31.300
units.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.180
And this is a distinctly engineering approach.

16:34.180 --> 16:38.740
It's no longer just tinkering with one gene or another to see what happens, but it's

16:38.740 --> 16:41.780
actually with a purpose to build more complex systems.

16:42.420 --> 16:48.260
And here we are, what, 23 years later, and, you know, we're still struggling with a lot

16:48.260 --> 16:49.620
of these designs.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.780
We can build more complicated circuits now.

16:52.500 --> 16:56.580
Instead of one or two genes, we can build circuits with tens of genes.

16:57.140 --> 16:58.900
But there's still lots of challenges.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.380
So I think the field is still in its infancy.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.860
A huge promise, of course, but lots of challenges.

17:05.860 --> 17:11.300
So I think for researchers who want to work in this field, I think this is a very good

17:11.300 --> 17:12.340
time to be doing it.

17:13.620 --> 17:16.260
There's a lot to unpack in what you just mentioned.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.420
I don't know where to start.

17:18.820 --> 17:24.180
One of the things that made me think when you were elaborating on your thoughts was

17:24.180 --> 17:30.740
that you touched on so many elementary components that are very familiar to the area of

17:30.740 --> 17:31.300
computing.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.700
So switches, oscillators.

17:33.700 --> 17:38.900
So in hearing about these concepts, what I think about is a computer.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.980
So it seems like it's possible to assemble some sort of biological computer out of those

17:42.980 --> 17:43.540
components.

17:44.260 --> 17:49.140
The second thing that I'm extremely excited about is what we can actually do with these

17:49.140 --> 17:49.540
circuits.

17:49.540 --> 17:54.500
So the ones that you just mentioned and what is actually the time horizon in which we can

17:54.500 --> 17:57.460
hope to see something, let's say, in our lifetime.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.500
Is it going to be in two centuries, a millennia?

18:00.500 --> 18:01.140
Who knows?

18:01.140 --> 18:06.340
And the third thing that I would like to ask you is what are the main developments in the

18:06.340 --> 18:08.980
middle, let's say from 2000 to today?

18:08.980 --> 18:11.300
So what happened in between?

18:13.620 --> 18:19.540
Okay, so starting from the last part of your question, so what happened in between?

18:20.260 --> 18:25.860
I think that what happened is people started to build more complex circuits.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.340
And in the process, they ran into challenges.

18:31.300 --> 18:36.980
So there are various challenges when you're working with biological substrates that one

18:36.980 --> 18:39.380
does not find when working with electric circuits.

18:40.180 --> 18:44.500
Interestingly, a lot of people working in this field, synthetic and systems, synthetic

18:44.500 --> 18:48.100
biology in particular, have a background in physics or engineering and so on.

18:49.140 --> 18:54.580
So the electric circuit analogy has been a running theme throughout.

18:55.540 --> 19:00.580
And I think while this analogy had served the field well early on, I don't personally

19:00.580 --> 19:07.780
think it's any longer a useful analogy to continue to pursue for reasons we can discuss

19:07.780 --> 19:08.260
if you want.

19:09.460 --> 19:12.820
But the idea there was, you know, you want to modularize everything.

19:12.820 --> 19:18.580
So you want to build functional units that then you can combine together with other units

19:18.580 --> 19:23.620
in series or in parallel and be able to scale up that way.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.500
But biology didn't play well with this vision.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.380
There are many issues.

19:29.380 --> 19:34.420
For example, when you're doing electric circuits, communication or information is

19:34.420 --> 19:40.980
transmitted through conduits, wires that are very, very precise, and only the parts

19:40.980 --> 19:44.740
that talk to each other generally talk to each other, right?

19:44.740 --> 19:50.580
I mean, of course, you could have electromagnetic interference and so on, but most circuits

19:50.580 --> 19:51.620
don't have these issues.

19:52.660 --> 19:53.860
In biology, it's not like this.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.820
You know, all the molecules see all the other molecules.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.980
So the way you would transmit information is through specificity.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.860
You know, molecule A binds to molecule B.

20:03.860 --> 20:09.540
Maybe it binds molecule C a little bit, but really it's molecule B that it needs to

20:09.540 --> 20:10.180
interact with.

20:10.740 --> 20:13.700
So you end up with a lot of crosstalk like this.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.740
So that's one problem.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.580
Another problem is noise or stochasticity.

20:19.140 --> 20:24.340
So when you're working with electric circuits, you have your Ohm's law, you have your

20:24.340 --> 20:29.540
ordinary differential equations, or, you know, everything is more or less deterministic.

20:29.540 --> 20:34.020
Of course, one can still talk about shot noise and so on at various frequencies.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.780
But in biology, it's not like this at all.

20:35.780 --> 20:39.380
So molecules very often come in very low copy numbers.

20:39.380 --> 20:45.860
So you have one gene, for example, a handful of mRNAs, and these interactions between these

20:45.860 --> 20:50.420
low copy numbers species, they're random in nature.

20:51.460 --> 20:57.300
Molecule A interacts with molecule B only if they happen to bind, collide with each

20:57.300 --> 20:57.800
other.

20:58.260 --> 21:03.620
But maybe in the process or before that happens, molecule A interacts with molecule C first,

21:04.340 --> 21:06.580
and then some other reaction takes place.

21:06.580 --> 21:11.700
So really, the timing and order of chemical reactions when you have very low copy numbers

21:12.260 --> 21:12.900
is random.

21:14.260 --> 21:18.340
So this should be compared with what you've learned in chemistry in high school, where

21:18.340 --> 21:23.780
things are present in very large copy numbers, Avogadro's numbers in a test tube, where

21:23.780 --> 21:25.620
none of this is true.

21:25.620 --> 21:32.180
So you can actually approximate or you can safely describe the dynamics using ordinary

21:32.180 --> 21:33.140
differential equations.

21:33.140 --> 21:37.300
They're nonlinear, but, you know, that come from mass action kinetics or other type of

21:37.300 --> 21:37.780
kinetics.

21:37.780 --> 21:45.780
But in the end of the day, you get deterministic equations that represent continuous variables

21:46.500 --> 21:51.300
that describe the different concentrations of the different reactions, but not so inside

21:51.300 --> 21:56.980
the living cell where the copy numbers is low and the randomness is ever present.

21:57.540 --> 22:05.940
So a more suitable tool in this case is to look at, instead of continuous variables that

22:05.940 --> 22:12.260
evolve deterministically, you look at stochastic or random variables to represent the number

22:12.260 --> 22:19.540
of molecules for each of the different proteins or RNAs and the stochastic nature in which

22:19.540 --> 22:21.700
these random variables evolve.

22:21.700 --> 22:27.780
So really, the typical model that we work with in this case is a continuous time discrete

22:27.780 --> 22:33.780
state Markov process, and that's a much better representation of what's going on inside

22:33.780 --> 22:36.900
the living cell, especially when you have very low copy numbers.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.100
So noise is another big problem that one has to deal with.

22:40.100 --> 22:44.820
Of course, nonlinearity as well, because everything is nonlinear when you have chemical reactions.

22:45.620 --> 22:52.660
And so a wealth of mathematical as well as computational problems to deal with.

22:53.540 --> 22:53.780
Yeah.

22:53.780 --> 22:57.940
So what you just said, essentially you replied to a question that I wanted to ask you, which

22:57.940 --> 23:02.180
would be what are the challenges in controlling biomolecular systems?

23:02.180 --> 23:07.620
And to me, it seems like the scale in a way determines also the way you describe the processes

23:07.620 --> 23:08.820
that you're interested.

23:08.820 --> 23:14.340
As you said, there seems to be a fundamental difference between electrical circuits and

23:14.420 --> 23:16.900
biomolecular, if you want, systems.

23:17.460 --> 23:21.220
So, and I wonder what is the role of control engineering there?

23:21.220 --> 23:23.860
So what can we hope to achieve?

23:23.860 --> 23:25.860
What is the current progress there?

23:26.740 --> 23:28.740
And where are we going towards?

23:30.260 --> 23:36.180
I mean, I think I don't want to give the impression that one must only use these stochastic models,

23:36.180 --> 23:37.220
otherwise nothing works.

23:37.220 --> 23:41.060
Because depending on the problem that you're looking at and the scale that you're looking

23:41.060 --> 23:46.820
at, very often deterministic ordinary differential equations can still serve as good models for

23:46.820 --> 23:47.940
biological phenomena.

23:48.820 --> 23:53.140
Just one has to be careful that when you're looking inside the cell, especially smaller

23:53.140 --> 23:58.820
cells like bacteria, this assumption may be violated and you may end up with behaviors

23:58.820 --> 23:59.780
that are very different.

23:59.780 --> 24:04.100
Very often, actually, the most suitable approach is a hybrid one, where you have some variables

24:04.100 --> 24:11.300
that are stochastic and discrete, others are continuous and evolved deterministically,

24:11.300 --> 24:12.900
and they interact with each other.

24:12.900 --> 24:17.060
So, you know, this is probably the most useful model.

24:17.060 --> 24:19.380
So what control problems exist?

24:20.500 --> 24:26.740
Even if one sticks to the deterministic framework, and let's talk about this first, the issues

24:26.740 --> 24:32.420
that I mentioned before, crosstalk is one of them, you would like to do regulation,

24:32.420 --> 24:36.820
you'd like to regulate certain variables, and these variables, for example, must track

24:36.820 --> 24:44.260
certain set points or reject certain disturbances, so you end up with a control problem.

24:44.260 --> 24:48.820
You know, how do you design a feedback or feedforward mechanism that will implement

24:49.700 --> 24:52.420
this or that would meet these control specifications?

24:52.420 --> 24:54.740
So what is so challenging about biology?

24:55.300 --> 25:00.660
Well, for one thing, again, we're sticking even to deterministic descriptions, all the

25:00.660 --> 25:02.820
variables are positive variables.

25:02.820 --> 25:06.980
So whatever you want to do, it has to be done with positive quantities, right?

25:06.980 --> 25:08.100
So positive systems.

25:08.740 --> 25:12.260
I mean, that's one of the main challenges.

25:12.260 --> 25:20.100
The functions that you build, the controllers that you have to synthesize, you cannot just

25:20.100 --> 25:23.700
write a transfer function and just say, please build me this transfer function, you know,

25:23.700 --> 25:25.460
or this nonlinear function.

25:26.340 --> 25:30.020
You are constrained by chemical reactions.

25:30.020 --> 25:35.380
So everything that you want to implement, your controller, for example, has to be implementable

25:36.100 --> 25:38.420
using biochemical reactions, right?

25:38.420 --> 25:40.820
So that also adds a second constraint.

25:41.380 --> 25:46.500
And it's the interplay of these two constraints, the positivity of the variables plus the

25:47.060 --> 25:51.620
constraints that are imposed by the type of interactions you can have inside a living

25:51.620 --> 25:56.260
cell, I think give biology the distinctive flavor that it has.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.940
And it opens up a wealth of problems in control theory.

25:59.940 --> 26:03.620
What kind of controllers can you build using these chemical reactions?

26:03.620 --> 26:09.380
How would you achieve, let's say, perfect tracking, robust steady state tracking with

26:09.380 --> 26:12.660
these type of controllers and these type of networks?

26:13.380 --> 26:18.180
They have to be positive, they have to be implementable, realizable as a chemical reaction.

26:18.180 --> 26:23.060
Can you realize any transfer function, or can you approximate it using biochemical reactions?

26:23.060 --> 26:28.260
So there's really a wealth of problems that control theory can contribute to.

26:29.460 --> 26:33.220
And I'm not saying that existing control theory can address these things, and that's really

26:33.220 --> 26:38.500
the beauty of this, is that it's not just, you know, here, I'm just going to move the

26:38.500 --> 26:43.220
methods that people have already developed in our field and just apply them to control

26:43.220 --> 26:44.580
theory, to biology.

26:44.580 --> 26:45.860
That would be the wrong approach.

26:46.740 --> 26:52.340
I think one has to be open-minded, and you look at the problems that emerge in biology,

26:52.340 --> 27:01.940
and more often than not, you have to develop a new control theory that is suited for biology.

27:01.940 --> 27:04.980
And I think that's even more fun that way.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.140
So that's what we do in my lab.

27:07.140 --> 27:14.020
We try to develop a control theory, a new foundation for control theory at the molecular

27:14.020 --> 27:20.340
scale, and then we also try to build these chemical reaction mechanisms using genetic

27:20.340 --> 27:21.300
engineering tools.

27:22.020 --> 27:29.220
And so I think for me, at least, the challenging part is also the most fun and interesting

27:29.220 --> 27:32.420
part, is where the theory and the experiments meet.

27:33.140 --> 27:38.980
The theoretical questions are motivated by the experimental considerations, and the experiments

27:38.980 --> 27:43.140
we do are always guided or informed by the theory we develop.

27:43.140 --> 27:48.900
And there's this interaction, very close interaction, that I think is just, you know,

27:49.460 --> 27:54.820
every time theory impacts the experiment, I really get a kick out of this in the lab.

27:54.820 --> 28:02.340
And I think that's sitting at the boundary between the experimental world and the control

28:02.340 --> 28:06.660
theoretic world is really a very good place to be, at least for me.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.500
It sounds incredibly interesting.

28:08.580 --> 28:13.300
I just want to comment on what you mentioned before about the constraints, if you want,

28:13.300 --> 28:14.580
that biology imposes.

28:15.140 --> 28:20.580
So maybe just to clarify the fact that all variables need to be positive, I guess that's

28:20.580 --> 28:25.780
because we're always talking about concepts that are quantified quantities of things that

28:25.780 --> 28:29.540
are out there, or I guess fluxes or other...

28:29.540 --> 28:30.260
Concentrations.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.780
Concentrations, exactly.

28:31.780 --> 28:37.860
So it's incredible how positive system theory there has a huge role.

28:38.500 --> 28:42.740
And the second thing that I wanted to mention is related to the question of realization

28:42.740 --> 28:43.780
that you mentioned before.

28:44.340 --> 28:49.460
I find it very fascinating that in this context, you're very much constrained, as you mentioned

28:49.460 --> 28:50.660
by chemistry.

28:50.660 --> 28:56.180
And so the realization theory, if you want, that you can build out of these systems has

28:56.180 --> 28:57.620
to comply with those rules.

28:58.180 --> 29:04.260
And I guess it imposes huge constraints because everything has to comply with the law of mass

29:04.260 --> 29:07.940
action or with those nonlinear equations.

29:07.940 --> 29:13.780
And therefore, it's very, very different from, again, the world, the realm of electricity.

29:14.420 --> 29:19.380
But I also thought that maybe this is actually a good point, as you mentioned about the work

29:19.380 --> 29:24.100
of your lab, to shift gears and to start talking about motifs.

29:24.100 --> 29:30.100
And one of the motifs that your lab has developed, which I find incredibly interesting, as a

29:30.100 --> 29:35.220
preview to the listeners, we're going to talk about one of the first PI controllers, if

29:35.220 --> 29:40.100
not the first, I'm not sure about it, but I think it's the first, in biomolecular systems.

29:40.100 --> 29:45.220
And this is something that gets me incredibly excited about the future of this branch of

29:46.020 --> 29:48.820
control theory and systems and synthetic biology.

29:50.180 --> 29:53.700
Yeah, so biologists like to talk about motifs.

29:54.580 --> 29:59.460
That's not a word that exists, I guess, or is commonly used in our field in control

29:59.460 --> 29:59.860
theory.

30:00.420 --> 30:02.820
So let me just explain what a motif is.

30:02.820 --> 30:10.340
So a motif is usually just a pattern that recurs with a frequency that is much higher

30:10.340 --> 30:12.660
than one would expect if it were by chance.

30:13.540 --> 30:19.300
So you could have a motif in terms of a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA that repeats.

30:19.300 --> 30:23.140
What we're more interested in is network motifs.

30:23.140 --> 30:30.420
And so these are simple network elements that implement a certain function that you

30:30.420 --> 30:36.260
usually see much more frequently than chance, such that this small network forms a basis

30:36.260 --> 30:39.300
for much more complex biological behavior.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.220
So one example of that is a feedback loop.

30:41.220 --> 30:47.460
So that would be a simple network motif, or a feedforward loop, or let's say an oscillator,

30:47.460 --> 30:48.900
or a positive feedback loop.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.340
So those are the different motifs.

30:51.220 --> 30:58.100
When I first joined ETH in 2011, before actually joining, I was just doing purely systems biology,

30:58.100 --> 30:59.940
so more analysis, system theory.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.860
Now coming to ETH, I had the opportunity to start my own lab.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.780
I have to say, before that, I hadn't touched a test tube in my life.

31:07.780 --> 31:13.300
So it was a bit of an experience to kind of try to learn all of these techniques and build

31:13.300 --> 31:15.300
a wet lab from scratch.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.660
But I already had tenure.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.460
I had nothing to lose.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.220
And so if it didn't work, I would just close it.

31:23.220 --> 31:24.180
That's the way you do it.

31:24.180 --> 31:27.380
Continue doing theory as usual.

31:28.100 --> 31:31.700
And that was one of the best decisions I had made, actually, professionally, is to start

31:31.700 --> 31:32.260
a wet lab.

31:32.260 --> 31:37.300
Initially, I thought I would just have one bench with one student, maybe doing some experiments

31:37.300 --> 31:39.860
to verify the theory.

31:40.580 --> 31:46.500
Right now, I have more than 16 different benches, and my group is actually more than half people

31:46.500 --> 31:47.380
doing experiments.

31:47.940 --> 31:51.300
So it's been a really very rewarding experience.

31:52.260 --> 31:53.940
We didn't do it at the expense of theory.

31:53.940 --> 32:00.660
We just sort of just added to the theoretical work and gave it much more color and life

32:00.660 --> 32:01.620
and meaning.

32:02.260 --> 32:06.820
And also to the theoretical questions that we ask are now very different, because they're

32:06.820 --> 32:08.980
driven by what we see in the lab.

32:08.980 --> 32:17.060
So having the ability to do experiments meant to me that now I can switch from doing system

32:17.140 --> 32:19.620
theory to doing control theory.

32:19.620 --> 32:21.140
So now we could do synthesis.

32:21.140 --> 32:26.580
It didn't really make much sense to do synthesis if you're just doing analyzing existing systems.

32:26.580 --> 32:31.860
Now, suppose you would like to design a new feature or you would like to control a living

32:31.860 --> 32:33.380
cell in one way or another.

32:34.340 --> 32:42.740
We started by using a technique that had been developed earlier called optogenetics, namely

32:43.380 --> 32:47.860
developing cells that are actually sensitive to light so that you can actually control

32:47.860 --> 32:50.660
them by shining light with different intensities.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.980
That was the earlier problem.

32:52.980 --> 32:58.740
So we would control, we would still use computer controllers, but the computer controllers

32:58.740 --> 33:05.540
would send out signals that are light signals whose intensities actually serve as the actuation.

33:06.100 --> 33:11.620
That was fun, and we actually were able to build the first feedback control system.

33:12.580 --> 33:16.100
The computer controlled the gene expression at the time.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.300
This was 2011.

33:18.100 --> 33:25.940
But then another experience that I had in the past, namely integral feedback, came to

33:25.940 --> 33:26.500
the front.

33:26.980 --> 33:32.900
And the question was, can we build integral feedback controllers inside living cells?

33:33.700 --> 33:38.660
You know, having shown that these systems naturally exist, for example, in calcium and

33:38.660 --> 33:44.340
many other systems, it was obvious to ask the question, how would you build one?

33:44.340 --> 33:46.820
Nobody had built integral feedback controllers.

33:47.540 --> 33:53.300
And then, you know, we started trying to build a system that mimics the calcium homeostasis,

33:53.300 --> 33:59.220
and we spent a lot of time on it, several years, two or three years, not really very

33:59.220 --> 33:59.940
successfully.

34:00.660 --> 34:07.220
One time, we thought we had it, and it was exhibiting zero steady state tracking errors,

34:07.220 --> 34:09.140
everything that an integrator should do.

34:09.860 --> 34:12.820
But to our disappointment, it was actually an artifact.

34:12.820 --> 34:17.380
We discovered it was a biological artifact, and what we are seeing was not really the

34:17.380 --> 34:19.220
action of an integral feedback controller.

34:19.220 --> 34:25.220
It was a combination of negative feedback with disturbance feedforward that was behaving

34:26.020 --> 34:28.100
very much like what an integrator would do.

34:28.900 --> 34:35.860
And this went on for quite a while, and then I think the breakthrough came from the theory

34:35.860 --> 34:36.180
side.

34:36.820 --> 34:43.540
We had come up with a new motif that, which now we call, I called it the antithetic motif

34:43.540 --> 34:47.780
for a reason that has to do with the way the molecules interact with each other.

34:47.780 --> 34:55.220
So this antithetic motif, on paper, should be able to implement or realize integral feedback.

34:55.860 --> 35:01.860
And it required two molecules, and you know, you can do negative variables by having two

35:01.860 --> 35:04.340
positive variables and look at their difference, essentially.

35:04.900 --> 35:11.780
And so this motif is a kind of a sequestration or annihilation motif, to use the term we

35:11.780 --> 35:12.900
like to use in biology.

35:12.900 --> 35:18.420
But essentially, two molecules bind with each other, and they prevent each other from being

35:18.420 --> 35:19.220
active.

35:19.220 --> 35:24.900
And one can use that behavior to realize integral feedback control systems.

35:25.460 --> 35:26.900
And so the theory was nice.

35:26.900 --> 35:32.100
And in fact, it turns out that these type of integral feedback controllers are also

35:32.100 --> 35:32.980
noise resistant.

35:33.620 --> 35:37.780
So they allow us to solve this problem with stochasticity or noise.

35:37.780 --> 35:42.900
In fact, they would exploit noise so that they would function better in the presence

35:42.900 --> 35:43.380
of noise.

35:43.380 --> 35:48.020
Whereas if the system was noise-free, one would observe oscillations.

35:48.020 --> 35:53.140
Now the presence of noise would actually lead to a dampening of this oscillation.

35:53.140 --> 35:56.500
Very counterintuitive, but one can prove this mathematically.

35:57.300 --> 36:02.420
And so then there was a sudden and abrupt switch in the lab.

36:02.980 --> 36:06.260
Okay, drop everything that you're doing with these other systems.

36:06.260 --> 36:09.220
Let's now try to implement these antithetic controllers.

36:09.780 --> 36:14.900
It still took a good year and a half to two years to build them and verify that they were

36:14.900 --> 36:15.460
functional.

36:16.580 --> 36:21.780
But in fact, because we had to find the right biological molecules that had the behavior

36:21.780 --> 36:25.460
that we were looking for, and it was a very stringent constraint.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.620
You know, these molecules have to sequester each other.

36:27.620 --> 36:32.340
Once they're bound, they could not function anymore to actuate.

36:32.340 --> 36:37.300
And so we found them in the form of what's called sigma factors that exist already in

36:37.300 --> 36:37.860
biology.

36:38.500 --> 36:43.780
Once we built it, we could verify that we actually have an integral feedback controller

36:43.780 --> 36:44.420
on our hands.

36:45.220 --> 36:51.220
And I think these were very happy times because it really, from beginning to end, it took

36:51.220 --> 36:55.220
a good part of seven years to build that first integral feedback controller.

36:55.220 --> 36:58.740
But it was a glorious moment when this finally worked.

36:59.620 --> 37:02.980
The paper appeared in Nature in 2019.

37:03.620 --> 37:10.900
Now, to 2023, you know, we can build many of these, let's say one every two or three

37:10.900 --> 37:14.420
months, with much better properties, better dynamic range.

37:14.420 --> 37:17.380
It works in mammalian cells and bacterial cells.

37:17.380 --> 37:22.020
So, you know, once we had that first integrator, we started learning about its property and

37:22.020 --> 37:23.060
how to optimize it.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.100
We have advanced quite a lot since then.

37:27.220 --> 37:33.140
That must have felt like a real eureka moment, almost like in Harold Black developing the

37:33.140 --> 37:34.660
negative feedback amplifier.

37:36.100 --> 37:42.980
At least for me, it was, you know, the culmination of a lot of attempts, failed attempts and

37:42.980 --> 37:43.780
a lot of effort.

37:44.420 --> 37:51.380
For people in the lab, it was salvation because they no longer had to keep doing these experiments

37:51.380 --> 37:52.420
that would take a long time.

37:52.420 --> 37:56.660
You see, when you want to do, let's say, a simple time course, you know, and if you're

37:56.660 --> 38:01.620
building a circuit, you know, you put a scope, a oscilloscope, and then you look at the voltage

38:01.620 --> 38:04.260
up and you see whether steady state is achieved or not.

38:04.260 --> 38:08.980
In biology, you know, steady state happens after 10 hours.

38:08.980 --> 38:15.460
And so if you want to do a time course, then you have to do samples every so often during

38:15.460 --> 38:20.580
this time course, and you have to do all sorts of dilution processes and freezing of these

38:20.580 --> 38:25.940
samples and so on just to get one trace, only to find out that it hasn't worked for one

38:25.940 --> 38:26.740
reason or another.

38:27.380 --> 38:31.140
So it was a very grueling experience for people in the lab.

38:31.860 --> 38:39.220
And when the new theory was developed, there was another small gift that came with this

38:39.220 --> 38:47.860
theory, and that is that we could show that in the presence of noise, this motif is the

38:47.860 --> 38:50.500
only motif that will implement integral feedback.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.780
So this is kind of a necessary condition.

38:53.780 --> 39:00.180
And the reason why this was good news for the experimentalists is just a realization

39:00.900 --> 39:02.980
that this is the right motif.

39:02.980 --> 39:06.260
We're not missing another motif that could have done this easier.

39:07.060 --> 39:10.900
If it is to work, this is the only way it would work, right?

39:10.900 --> 39:18.420
So this was completely reassuring, and it was just a matter of time when they got the

39:18.420 --> 39:22.500
circuits to actually work the way we were expecting that they would work.

39:23.460 --> 39:27.460
This is incredibly exciting, at least for me as a follower of this story.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.260
It's fantastic.

39:28.900 --> 39:33.540
I would like to dissect so many of the things that we touched on just in the last few minutes,

39:33.540 --> 39:40.820
because we inadvertently touched on the enabling technologies that allowed this Eureka moment

39:40.820 --> 39:41.380
to happen.

39:42.100 --> 39:47.540
We also touched on the concept of antithetic integral feedback that I would like to dig

39:47.540 --> 39:48.900
into a little bit more.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.300
Yeah, maybe we can start from the former.

39:52.500 --> 39:58.980
Initially, you were speaking about optogenetics, which, pun intended, allowed you to shed new

39:58.980 --> 40:03.380
light on these biomolecular phenomena.

40:03.380 --> 40:08.420
Maybe we can talk about the enabling technologies that allowed control theory to actually

40:08.420 --> 40:10.180
implement these circuits.

40:11.540 --> 40:16.820
Yeah, I think when I think of cybergenetics, at least the way I've thought about it, when

40:17.540 --> 40:23.780
coming up with ways to do cellular control, one can think of two different flavors, right?

40:23.780 --> 40:25.300
So general flavors.

40:25.300 --> 40:30.900
One flavor, which is using computers to control living cells, so computers in the loop.

40:32.180 --> 40:36.740
There, implementing any control system you like is easy and possible.

40:37.540 --> 40:40.820
The challenge there is to interface the computer with the cell.

40:41.380 --> 40:42.580
So what do you need for that?

40:42.580 --> 40:44.580
Well, you need sensors and you need actuators.

40:45.220 --> 40:49.620
In terms of the sensors, we would like to measure what the cell is doing.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.460
Let's say how much gene is expressed.

40:52.180 --> 40:53.860
I mean, this problem had been worked out.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.700
There was a topic of a Nobel Prize 2008 in chemistry.

40:58.260 --> 41:03.780
That's the well-known fluorescent protein, the discovery of the green fluorescent protein.

41:03.780 --> 41:05.700
The main idea there is very simple.

41:05.700 --> 41:09.380
If you have a protein that's being expressed by your gene, what you do is you genetically

41:09.380 --> 41:14.740
engineer your gene such that, in addition to that protein, it fuses another protein

41:14.740 --> 41:16.100
that fluoresces.

41:16.100 --> 41:21.300
So when that original protein is expressed, attached to it is another fluorescent protein.

41:21.300 --> 41:25.620
And by measuring the intensity of this fluorescence, you get an idea about the abundance of the

41:25.620 --> 41:26.420
expressed protein.

41:26.420 --> 41:28.260
And so that's one way to measure.

41:28.900 --> 41:35.140
Initially, this was green fluorescent protein, but I think it wasn't long before other colors

41:35.220 --> 41:37.940
where other wavelengths were developed.

41:37.940 --> 41:41.460
And so one can look at multiple proteins simultaneously.

41:41.460 --> 41:44.740
So you can do even multivariable control if you want.

41:45.460 --> 41:48.340
But still very challenging with a single output.

41:48.340 --> 41:52.100
So the idea, though, we can measure protein abundances.

41:52.660 --> 41:55.460
So that solves the problem of sensing.

41:56.100 --> 42:00.500
For that, you could either have your cells under a microscope, and then you would image

42:00.500 --> 42:06.020
it, and you would, you know, see how much fluorescence that your cells have and quantify

42:06.020 --> 42:06.260
that.

42:06.900 --> 42:11.940
Or there's another device called a flow cytometer, which allows you to put a cell through a

42:11.940 --> 42:14.820
microfluidic channel, shine a laser on it, see how much fluorescence.

42:14.820 --> 42:19.220
So you can count the fluorescence of each individual cell, and you could do this for

42:19.220 --> 42:21.380
hundreds of thousands of cells a minute.

42:21.380 --> 42:24.100
So you can get a nice distribution for your population.

42:24.660 --> 42:29.060
You can think of this as a snapshot of the probability density function of the expression.

42:29.940 --> 42:35.140
So you can measure, you feed that to the computer, and then to actuate was a problem.

42:35.140 --> 42:39.860
So how would we tell the cells how to express, how much to express based on what the computer

42:39.860 --> 42:40.340
computes?

42:41.460 --> 42:44.420
There, I think we found optogenetics.

42:44.420 --> 42:47.380
And that was a technique that has been developed recently.

42:48.020 --> 42:49.380
At the time, it was recent.

42:49.380 --> 42:51.140
I guess now it's no longer recent.

42:51.140 --> 42:58.260
So it allows cells to be light sensitive so that the more light you shine on the cell,

42:58.260 --> 43:00.740
the more the gene is expressed.

43:00.740 --> 43:02.340
OK, so this is an actuator.

43:02.980 --> 43:08.260
We had since developed our own optogenetic systems in bacteria, in yeast, and in mammalian

43:08.260 --> 43:12.020
cells that are particularly suited for control applications.

43:12.020 --> 43:17.140
But at the time, we just used what was already out there, and it was sufficient.

43:17.860 --> 43:22.260
Now you could do sensing, you could do actuation, and you can close the feedback loop with a

43:22.260 --> 43:26.980
computer in the loop, and then you can control gene expression, which is something we managed

43:26.980 --> 43:28.740
to do in 2011.

43:29.460 --> 43:35.860
Since then, we've been using this technology to control cells in a bioreactor so that we

43:35.860 --> 43:41.060
can optimize various protein products and various other applications.

43:41.060 --> 43:43.780
So this is one flavor where the computer is in the loop.

43:43.780 --> 43:49.940
The other flavor, which is actually in many ways is a bit harder, would be the controller

43:49.940 --> 43:51.540
is in the cell, right?

43:51.540 --> 43:58.260
So you have to genetically engineer the control system so that once you have a genetically

43:58.260 --> 44:03.940
modified cell, when the genes, modified genes are expressed, they produce proteins that

44:04.820 --> 44:09.540
interact with each other in a way that realizes your control system.

44:09.540 --> 44:12.180
So this is what we had to do with the integral controller.

44:12.180 --> 44:18.660
We had to modify genetically the cells, in that case it was E. coli at the time, so that

44:18.660 --> 44:24.820
they express these sigma factors that aren't normally there in that particular bacterium.

44:25.780 --> 44:27.540
It comes from another bacterium.

44:27.540 --> 44:34.820
And such that when these proteins are expressed, they implement this antithetic motif and in

44:34.820 --> 44:36.580
the process close the feedback loop.

44:37.540 --> 44:40.180
So that's the genetically engineered controls.

44:40.180 --> 44:43.460
And that's the second flavor of a feedback control.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.140
Thanks for that.

44:45.140 --> 44:51.140
You're doing an excellent job in clarifying, at least to me, how should I just visualize

44:51.140 --> 44:53.860
even systems that you're acting on?

44:53.860 --> 44:59.300
So I guess in my imagination, at least, I'm visualizing a microscope endowed with some

44:59.300 --> 45:01.940
tool that allows you to shine light onto.

45:01.940 --> 45:06.180
We have our cells in little containers that shine light through them.

45:06.900 --> 45:13.620
And in that particular case, we had to develop new technology to allow us to shine light

45:13.620 --> 45:15.380
on individual cells.

45:15.380 --> 45:21.220
And that's kind of, again, using MEMS technology, microelectromechanical systems.

45:21.780 --> 45:25.140
So technology that was developed for projectors.

45:25.140 --> 45:29.140
And these are called digital micromirror devices.

45:29.140 --> 45:34.820
So these are, you can think about it as an array of millions of micromirrors, each of

45:34.820 --> 45:37.540
which can be controlled with an electrostatic field.

45:37.540 --> 45:41.700
And in this way, you can point the mirrors any direction you want.

45:41.700 --> 45:48.900
So you can shine light on a single cell or on even a subcellular compartment with the

45:48.900 --> 45:50.340
intensity that you want.

45:50.340 --> 45:55.540
So this allows us to very, very precisely target individual cells.

45:55.540 --> 45:58.260
And we can have a controller for that one cell.

45:58.260 --> 46:02.900
You cannot see it with your naked eye, but there's a controller in the computer running

46:02.900 --> 46:04.740
in feedback for that particular cell.

46:04.740 --> 46:08.900
And you can do this simultaneously and in parallel for thousands of cells.

46:09.620 --> 46:16.420
And so that's, again, brings in technology to allow us to do the feedback control of

46:16.420 --> 46:17.620
individual cells.

46:17.620 --> 46:18.820
I was about to mention that.

46:18.820 --> 46:24.340
So there is an immense challenge also from a technological perspective in order to implement

46:24.340 --> 46:30.820
actuators, as you say, and sensors, which seems to be something easy as we, at least

46:30.820 --> 46:34.260
you make it sound like it's something easy, but it's definitely not.

46:34.260 --> 46:37.220
It's a huge component of your work, I guess.

46:38.100 --> 46:42.420
But I also found very interesting what you mentioned about controllers that are acting

46:42.420 --> 46:43.940
in living cells.

46:43.940 --> 46:48.340
And I was wondering, what do you use as media to create those controllers?

46:48.340 --> 46:52.340
Should I imagine viruses acting into a cell or how does it work?

46:53.540 --> 46:56.260
So how do we introduce our controllers?

46:56.260 --> 46:56.820
Exactly.

46:56.820 --> 46:57.380
Yeah, yeah.

46:59.140 --> 47:01.380
I mean, there are different ways.

47:01.380 --> 47:05.540
So in the lab, what we normally do is we use electroporation.

47:05.540 --> 47:14.020
So a process by which you subject the cells to an electric field and their membranes become

47:14.020 --> 47:18.020
more…allows you to introduce genetic material inside the cell.

47:18.020 --> 47:23.780
So this is by far the most common way, electroporation.

47:24.340 --> 47:27.620
And that works reasonably well.

47:27.620 --> 47:32.100
So it allows you to introduce new genetic material inside the cell.

47:32.580 --> 47:38.900
In a lot of the treatments that people do, if you want to access, let's say, cells in a

47:38.900 --> 47:43.940
living human or in a mouse model, there are different vehicles.

47:43.940 --> 47:51.060
So one can think of using viruses, lentiviruses, as a vehicle for delivering genetic material.

47:51.060 --> 47:58.100
And viruses have evolved to be very efficient and effective at penetrating host cells and

47:58.100 --> 48:01.860
to deliver their own DNA to infect the cell.

48:01.940 --> 48:06.340
So now people can or biologists can exploit that feature.

48:06.340 --> 48:11.300
And instead of having the native DNA of the virus, they introduce their own, let's say,

48:11.300 --> 48:16.660
therapeutic genetic material into that virus that then goes on to deliver the material.

48:16.660 --> 48:22.500
So these are some of the tricks by which you would introduce novel genetic material that

48:22.500 --> 48:26.580
then gets expressed into your favorite circuit, synthetic circuit.

48:27.140 --> 48:28.420
That's incredible.

48:29.140 --> 48:33.300
Again, it sounds like science fiction, but it's incredible that we're actually able to

48:33.300 --> 48:34.100
do such things.

48:35.060 --> 48:39.460
I'd like to take a step back before we move on towards something that I find incredibly

48:39.460 --> 48:39.860
exciting.

48:39.860 --> 48:42.340
So the applications of all these ideas.

48:42.340 --> 48:44.340
What can we hope to achieve with these tools?

48:44.980 --> 48:49.700
Spending the last few words maybe on the antithetic integral feedback motif.

48:49.700 --> 48:54.660
First of all, I'd like to understand the reason of calling it antithetic integral feedback.

48:55.220 --> 49:00.260
And then I'd like to understand how it works a little bit from a control theoretic perspective.

49:01.940 --> 49:02.260
Okay.

49:04.340 --> 49:05.300
Without equations.

49:07.380 --> 49:09.780
I understand it's a huge challenge, but we can try.

49:09.780 --> 49:10.100
Yeah.

49:10.100 --> 49:10.420
Okay.

49:10.420 --> 49:11.860
So why it's called antithetic?

49:11.860 --> 49:14.020
Well, that goes back to the way this works.

49:14.020 --> 49:19.380
So at the basis of this antithetic controller are two controller molecules.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.460
We call them Z1 and Z2.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.380
One molecule, Z1, gets expressed at a constant rate.

49:26.180 --> 49:26.500
Okay.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.420
And it's stable, so it doesn't degrade.

49:28.420 --> 49:31.140
So you're just producing this molecule at a constant rate.

49:31.780 --> 49:34.900
The other molecule, Z2, acts like a sensor.

49:34.900 --> 49:39.860
And so the rate of production depends on the abundance of the molecule you want to regulate.

49:39.860 --> 49:40.740
Okay.

49:40.740 --> 49:48.340
So the rate of synthesis of Z2 is proportional to the variable, let's say, x, that you want

49:48.340 --> 49:49.220
to keep constant.

49:49.940 --> 49:57.300
And now the reaction, the key reaction underlying this motif is a reaction in which one molecule

49:57.300 --> 50:03.140
of Z1 binds to another molecule of Z2, and they mutually annihilate each other.

50:03.860 --> 50:06.020
Strictly speaking, they don't have to annihilate each other.

50:06.020 --> 50:10.660
They could still be bound as long as the complex is not functional, things will still work.

50:10.660 --> 50:12.820
But let's just say they annihilate each other.

50:12.820 --> 50:13.620
Okay.

50:13.620 --> 50:14.260
One to one.

50:15.060 --> 50:21.540
So this process is, I mean, so the two molecules are in some ways antagonistic to each other.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.860
That's the name, antithetic control.

50:24.500 --> 50:30.820
In fact, when I called it that, I didn't have any idea that actually many of the motifs

50:30.820 --> 50:37.620
we will find out later on to implement this are things like sigma factor anti-sigma.

50:37.620 --> 50:41.940
They were already called like this, you know, sigma anti-sigma, toxin anti-toxin, you know,

50:41.940 --> 50:42.900
holon anti-holon.

50:42.900 --> 50:49.700
These are all pairs of molecules that have exactly the property we want for realizing

50:49.700 --> 50:50.900
this motif.

50:51.540 --> 50:57.060
And so it was appropriate to use that antithetic terminology, it was fortunate that we used

50:57.060 --> 50:57.700
it at the time.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.700
So how does this work?

51:00.980 --> 51:07.780
Yeah, that's, so if you think about this operation, Z1 and Z2, and, you know, they have this

51:08.980 --> 51:11.460
property that they bind with each other.

51:11.460 --> 51:16.980
If you have an abundance of Z1 and abundance of Z2, and let's say they bind together one

51:16.980 --> 51:25.300
to one, then what's left is the difference, right, between Z1 or Z2, if it's positive

51:25.300 --> 51:25.620
or not.

51:25.620 --> 51:28.580
So this allows you to do this positive negative type of thing.

51:29.300 --> 51:33.460
And the integration happens because of the nature of the operation.

51:33.460 --> 51:36.420
These things are being produced at a dynamic rate.

51:37.140 --> 51:44.980
And so when you subtract the dynamics of production of Z1 and Z2, what you're left with is the

51:44.980 --> 51:46.500
difference between them.

51:46.500 --> 51:51.540
The dynamics of the difference is what actually implements the integral of the error.

51:52.580 --> 51:58.340
So the difference of two positive quantities can be positive or negative.

51:58.340 --> 52:02.100
So this allows us to also overcome this issue with the sign.

52:02.660 --> 52:04.980
I mean, that's roughly speaking.

52:06.980 --> 52:13.140
And I can show you in the right, you know, in 30 seconds if I write the equation.

52:13.940 --> 52:17.940
Now, of course, there will be a link in the description to everything that we talked about.

52:17.940 --> 52:24.740
So of course, the Nature paper from 2019, but also a wonderful, I would call it an overview

52:24.740 --> 52:30.100
or almost a manifesto paper about cybergenetics that appeared on the proceedings of the IEEE

52:30.100 --> 52:31.300
in 2022.

52:31.860 --> 52:35.620
I just wanted to clarify for terminology for the audience of control theory.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.100
What does it mean actually to annihilate?

52:38.100 --> 52:39.300
And what does it mean to bind?

52:39.300 --> 52:43.540
I know that these are very naive questions, but it might be worth just mentioning what

52:43.540 --> 52:44.100
those mean.

52:44.100 --> 52:49.140
Yeah, I guess I should have explained those things because I myself had struggled with

52:49.140 --> 52:50.820
these concepts when I was first learning.

52:51.380 --> 52:57.300
So binding is the process in which two molecules combine and form a complex.

52:57.780 --> 53:04.100
So A plus B gives you C. C consists of both A and B, so this is a binding event.

53:04.100 --> 53:08.500
And now the bound species may have different properties, right?

53:09.140 --> 53:13.220
It could be inactive, whereas A and B are on their own active.

53:13.220 --> 53:15.460
When they bind together, they could annihilate.

53:15.460 --> 53:17.700
So they could inactivate each other.

53:17.700 --> 53:24.420
Annihilation just simply means that they mutually degrade each other, right?

53:24.420 --> 53:28.500
So that the protein is no longer functional.

53:28.500 --> 53:34.980
Maybe it's ideally it gets broken down into amino acids that get recycled.

53:35.620 --> 53:37.220
Very often that's not what actually happens.

53:37.220 --> 53:39.140
You don't really need it to be annihilated.

53:39.140 --> 53:40.900
It's just an idealization.

53:42.180 --> 53:45.060
All they need to do is just deactivate.

53:45.060 --> 53:49.700
They just need to be non-functional in the complex form.

53:49.700 --> 53:54.180
Should I picture it as the concentration exponentially decreases of this substance

53:54.180 --> 53:57.380
or what do you mean by it's no longer functional?

53:57.380 --> 54:00.740
Like, let's say, for example, Z1.

54:00.740 --> 54:06.580
Z1, in order to close the feedback loop, has to activate another gene that closes the feedback

54:06.580 --> 54:07.220
loop.

54:07.220 --> 54:10.660
Now, when it's bound to Z2, it can no longer do that.

54:10.660 --> 54:13.060
So it no longer acts as an activator.

54:13.060 --> 54:16.260
It's inert, if you wish, biologically inert.

54:17.060 --> 54:24.580
Whereas before the binding event, Z1 is a functional molecule that's a variable that

54:24.580 --> 54:27.780
activates other variables and closes the feedback loop.

54:27.780 --> 54:33.140
Now, once it's in that complex form, it's out of the picture.

54:33.140 --> 54:36.260
You can just completely ignore it in terms of the chemical reactions.

54:36.260 --> 54:37.380
It's no longer functional.

54:38.100 --> 54:42.980
So while we're on this subject, I also want to touch on two other things that I believe

54:42.980 --> 54:44.180
are incredibly exciting.

54:44.180 --> 54:50.660
So one of them is that, of course, after 2019, you moved forward and you added derivative

54:50.660 --> 54:51.620
action as well.

54:51.620 --> 54:54.260
I mean, proportional and derivative action.

54:54.260 --> 55:00.180
So at the moment, we do have a real PID controller for biomolecular systems.

55:00.180 --> 55:00.680
Am I right?

55:01.620 --> 55:02.420
Not quite.

55:03.460 --> 55:09.940
So we have since built PI controllers and demonstrated them in mammalian cells, which

55:09.940 --> 55:15.380
is always important because the way we want to use them for medical applications.

55:15.380 --> 55:21.460
We've also come up with all the right motifs that one would need to implement the derivative

55:21.460 --> 55:23.220
aspect of part of the controller.

55:23.860 --> 55:28.100
But we haven't to date demonstrated a PID.

55:28.100 --> 55:31.460
We have demonstrated a PI, but we're working on the last bit, the D.

55:32.260 --> 55:37.940
Admittedly, it's less important than the PI does most of the work that you need.

55:37.940 --> 55:43.940
So it's just, I think, it would be nice and satisfying to have the derivative component.

55:44.580 --> 55:45.460
This is another question.

55:45.460 --> 55:49.940
How would you implement different derivatives using biological component?

55:49.940 --> 55:56.020
I mean, it turns out if you know how to build an integrator and you put an integrator in

55:56.020 --> 56:02.820
a feedback loop with a unity feedforward path, then so if you have an identity for

56:02.820 --> 56:07.060
the forward loop and then an integrator in the feedback loop, what you end up with in

56:07.060 --> 56:11.780
the transfer function between the input and the output is actually a differentiator with

56:11.780 --> 56:13.860
a low-pass filter, which is exactly what we need.

56:13.860 --> 56:15.380
We need the low-pass filter as well.

56:16.420 --> 56:20.500
As you know, all differentiators have low-pass filters in practice.

56:21.140 --> 56:27.060
And so having implemented an integrator, we have the ingredient that's needed to

56:27.060 --> 56:28.740
implement a differentiator.

56:28.740 --> 56:31.380
It's not the only way, but it's actually one way to do it.

56:31.940 --> 56:36.420
And it's just, I think, a matter of time when this finally works.

56:36.420 --> 56:40.020
I think for applications, as I mentioned, it may not be necessary.

56:40.020 --> 56:44.100
There are reasons why you want to have a differentiator, similar to the reasons why

56:44.740 --> 56:48.180
control engineers in the field use PID and not just PI.

56:48.180 --> 56:53.060
You know, you can get faster response and good transients and so on.

56:53.060 --> 56:56.980
It could also reduce variability, so cell-to-cell variability.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.460
But strictly speaking, it's not necessary.

56:59.460 --> 57:05.620
In fact, you know, working in the field with a company when I was back in the U.S., I noticed

57:05.620 --> 57:11.140
that very often the engineers have PID controllers, but they actually have turned off the D part.

57:11.140 --> 57:12.980
They just use it as a PI.

57:12.980 --> 57:17.780
I guess 95% of the real PIDs actually do work like that.

57:17.780 --> 57:18.420
Yeah.

57:18.420 --> 57:23.940
I find very, very interesting the fact that, you know, the conceptual analogies that you

57:23.940 --> 57:26.900
do make with transfer functions actually work in practice.

57:26.900 --> 57:33.940
So one is guided by those concepts to realize something that is physically very, very different

57:33.940 --> 57:35.620
to the ideas that we have in mind.

57:36.180 --> 57:40.660
I also thought that before, you know, moving towards the applications and the future of

57:40.660 --> 57:45.620
this field, it would be interesting to talk about the actual systems that you do work on.

57:45.620 --> 57:51.380
You mentioned that mammalian cells are something that is important for demonstrative purposes,

57:51.380 --> 57:55.140
but generally that's not the only type of cell that you do work on, right?

57:56.100 --> 57:57.540
Yeah, that's correct.

57:57.540 --> 58:04.260
I mean, normally in this business, there are a few organisms that serve as model organisms

58:04.260 --> 58:07.060
where, you know, the genetics have been worked out.

58:07.060 --> 58:10.020
There's a lot of tools that people have used.

58:10.020 --> 58:15.860
And so, you know, people tend to work with those model organisms or model cells because

58:15.860 --> 58:17.220
life is much easier that way.

58:17.220 --> 58:19.140
I mean, biology is already hard enough.

58:19.140 --> 58:24.180
Why make it even more complicated by working on some exotic bacterium that, you know, perhaps

58:24.180 --> 58:26.580
the genetics of which haven't been worked out yet.

58:27.380 --> 58:32.180
And so some of these model organisms are things like E. coli, right?

58:32.180 --> 58:37.380
So E. coli is probably the best understood living organism, more than us.

58:38.020 --> 58:43.060
Yeast, budding yeast, so the baker's yeast is another model organism that kind of has

58:43.060 --> 58:46.100
a nucleus, unlike the bacteria that doesn't have a nucleus.

58:46.820 --> 58:50.740
So it's called the eukaryotic cell because of that.

58:50.740 --> 58:53.620
And of course, us, you know, that's mammalian cells, right?

58:54.180 --> 58:57.860
So the sizes of these cells differs drastically.

58:57.860 --> 59:03.620
So with the E. coli being the tiniest, and then the yeast in between, and the mammalian

59:03.620 --> 59:05.860
cells are huge in comparison.

59:06.420 --> 59:10.820
But also the genetic challenges are also different.

59:10.820 --> 59:14.180
So mammalian cells are more complicated to work with.

59:14.180 --> 59:15.300
They take more time.

59:16.260 --> 59:18.020
Reagents are much more expensive.

59:18.580 --> 59:21.220
But of course, they're much more important, right, for us.

59:21.220 --> 59:26.660
So if you're thinking about therapeutics, even if you want to do things like antibody

59:26.660 --> 59:32.900
production in a bioreactor, you still need to work with Joe cells, and those are mammalian

59:32.900 --> 59:33.400
cells.

59:33.940 --> 59:38.260
So the evolution of my lab started from E. coli.

59:38.260 --> 59:39.860
It was the simplest organism.

59:39.860 --> 59:42.580
It was the easiest to do genetic tests.

59:42.580 --> 59:44.340
It was the fastest and the cheapest.

59:44.900 --> 59:51.940
And then as we gained more confidence, we felt that if we are to have an impact on biomedical

59:51.940 --> 59:55.700
applications, we had better tackle the mammalian cells.

59:55.700 --> 59:59.940
And so gradually, we added yeast cells and as well as mammalian cells.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.540
And now I think most people in my group work on mammalian synthetic biology, with all the

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.100
challenges and also the opportunities that come with that.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.740
So and what type of mammalian cells, if I may ask?

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.620
So there are different types we work with.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.580
We work on cells called HeLa cells.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.220
These are one type of cells.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.820
Another type we work on are called HeK cells.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:30.180
And then we also work on stem cells, so mouse embryonic stem cells.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:34.660
So those are the three cell types that we mostly work with.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:38.740
And I think we will start soon working on Joe cells.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.740
So these are hamster cells, hamsteric cells.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.220
Okay.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.140
Yeah.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.140
So maybe now it's a good moment to shift gears and move towards the future.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:53.060
So the applications of this field that you dubbed cybergenetics, what can we actually

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:53.380
achieve?

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:58.180
I mean, I know that there are things nowadays that are science fiction, almost.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:03.780
We were chatting yesterday, just before recording this episode, that we can nowadays control

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:09.700
the firing, individual firing in nerve cells of mice or rats, I forget.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:14.900
So the ability to engineer living cells opens up quite a bit of possibilities.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:17.780
Yes, that's right.

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.580
I mean, one can think of it in different ways.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.340
I mean, you can think of agriculture.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:30.020
Of course, genetic engineering methods are well known in agriculture, but also industrial

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:30.980
biotechnology.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.940
So this is one area that I'm also excited about.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:44.020
You would like to be able to make a new protein, maybe more effectively or cheaply, and you

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:49.460
would like to do it in such a way that you can control the different enzymes and the

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:54.420
rate of flux at different pathways so that you can get just the optimal amount of protein

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:54.980
expression.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.700
Now, with cybergenetic techniques using light, we can do this.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:06.180
We have recently demonstrated that we can produce more, have higher yields by simply

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.020
closing the feedback loop.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:13.380
And in this case, one can measure, for example, the amount of stress a cell has through this

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:19.540
fluorescent protein technology that I told you about, and use that information to decide

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.620
how much expression a particular gene should have, right?

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:28.980
So if you have a gene that produces a product of interest, a protein of interest, overexpressing

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:34.260
it is not the best way to get more yield because then the cells get stressed and actually

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.380
your yield goes down.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:41.140
And if you underexpress, again, you're not exploiting the maximum capacity of your cell

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.740
to produce that protein.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.980
There's a sweet spot somewhere in between, and to try to find out where that sweet spot

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:52.260
is and to regulate gene expression, because this sweet spot is moving, you regulate the

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.140
gene expression so you're always tracking that sweet spot.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:03:00.740
This, I think, is one huge opportunity for cybergenetics in industrial biotechnology.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.940
Very often, the impediment is that you have intermediates that are toxic.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:12.580
And so by knowing what the levels of these intermediates are and adjusting variables

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.500
like gene expression, you can keep the toxicity level to the bare minimum and in the process

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.860
enhance the yield.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.700
So we have in my lab bioreactors or photobioreactors.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:31.140
So these are bioreactors that we have outfitted with LEDs, and we shine the light in feedback

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.980
to control the entire population.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:37.700
We're not doing single cell control, but we are looking at whole population level control.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:43.700
The other application I'm really excited about for synthetic biology is the therapeutic

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.540
applications, the medical implications.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.340
And that's more long term and more challenging.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.980
It takes longer time and also has lots of challenges.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:59.780
I mean, you want to have…anytime you put in a modified cell in a human, you need to

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.780
get FDA approval.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:06.740
It's a complex and long process, but it's also extremely promising.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:16.580
So one example of this is…so in, I think, 2017 or 2018, FDA approved the use of CAR-T

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.060
cells for immunotherapy.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:24.100
And this has been one of the most successful treatments for cancer, right?

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.620
So immunotherapy.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:32.900
So these are cells that are genetically modified to attack cancer cells, and essentially it

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.900
allows immune response, immune system to target cancer cells.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:42.020
And these cells originate from the patient or from a donor.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:46.340
They're modified in the lab and then put back into the patient's blood so that they

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.620
can treat diseases.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:54.660
So the problem is that all of these systems, these cell therapies, generally work in an

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.380
open loop.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:05:00.900
And so the idea is to actually bring in some of these controllers that we've been developing

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:06.660
and have these cells work in a closed loop fashion so that they're sensing the disease

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:14.020
state and then producing the amount of therapy, therapeutic, just the right amount to regulate

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:19.220
the level of, let's say, a particular biomarker, disease biomarker.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.220
And so that's the goal that we have in the lab, and that's what we're working towards.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:30.420
We're making better and better PID controllers or PI controllers, and then adding safety

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:37.620
features to them so that they can become, let's say, medical grade so that they have

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:42.660
anti-wind-up schemes and, you know, the usual things one has to worry about when implementing

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.300
integrators in the feedback loop.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:52.740
But really, if you really think about it, most of diseases are essentially due to or

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:56.900
can be attributed to feedback loops that have gone awry, right?

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.300
So, you know, think about cancer, think about diabetes, and so on.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:06.260
Many of the diseases we encounter are essentially due to the…

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.980
Genetic circuits going astray.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.540
Yeah, genetic circuits for various reasons, right?

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:18.420
And so, by having the technology to replace these with genetically engineered cells that

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:24.180
function as robust control systems, I think we would be able to contribute to disease.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.540
At least that's the guiding principle for us and for what we do.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.100
And, you know, we will see what happens.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.380
This is a long process.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.900
It's not something that you can do in the lab today and test it on people the next day.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:42.340
There has to be some different trials, clinical trials, different phases,

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.780
and it takes years and years.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.780
But we have to start somewhere.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.260
This is so, so cool.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.420
It is science fiction, and I think it's fantastic to watch, you know, from an external perspective.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:07:01.140
I kind of envision these things as almost like we are building genetic robots, which is

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:02.580
incredible.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.140
And I guess it also comes with very important ethical challenges.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.900
Is this something that you thought about?

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.540
Yes, I think ethics comes with synthetic biology from day one, right?

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:19.460
Anytime you want to modify something genetically, I think one has to think about the consequences.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:25.860
What we do in the lab, you know, these bacteria, they don't survive outside the lab.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.180
So whatever modifications we have will have no consequences.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:36.340
However, these days, the tools are available to do much more powerful genetic changes.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.620
For example, CRISPR-Cas.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:45.620
I think that this is a new technology that led to a Nobel Prize that allows scientists to

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.180
modify DNA with precision and efficiency.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:57.060
And this led to a lot of discussions about what one should be able to change or not to change.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:02.180
I mean, the danger, of course, is that you can have these CRISPR babies, as they're called.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:09.780
And there has been already some gross violations by one of the scientists who modified human

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:15.780
cells to have, you know, two new babies that have modified DNA.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.500
And I think that's very dangerous grounds.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:25.860
There's a fundamental difference between changing, let's say, regular cells and changing,

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.700
for example, skin cells or liver cells or cancer cells in one patient,

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:36.740
and changing cells that propagate, like, for example, sperm cells or egg cells,

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.940
because the genetic modifications are not restricted to the individual,

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.380
but they are passed on to their progeny.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.900
And that's much, much more dangerous.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.740
And I think this is something that we are not ready right now to,

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.380
or scientists are not ready to go down that path.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:00.500
There are certain other diseases where actually you could do a lot of good by modifying the DNA.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:06.660
Let's say, for example, some patients that have genes that have various mutations that

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.740
lead to diseases.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:13.540
And so if you can imagine modifying these genes through gene therapy, for example,

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:18.580
and reversing or correcting these mutations to restore normal functions,

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.940
I think that's a very exciting area of gene therapy.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:27.220
But whatever modifications are made are not passed on to the progeny.

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:31.380
So I think this is a safer way of doing genetic engineering.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.220
They're clearly dangerous, right?

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:40.740
So one has to watch out not to make modifications to a cell or, let's say, a bacterium that then

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.100
becomes more lethal and escapes the lab and so on.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:49.300
And so we have to put in place various measures to ensure that this never happens.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:54.180
And I think ethics goes hand in hand with this business of synthetic biology.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:59.460
Like many other technologies, I think one has to be careful to put in place the right

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:04.740
measures to make sure that the chances of accidents like that are basically zero.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:10.820
So with a lot of these, let's say, cell therapies, one hears about what's so-called kill switches.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.540
So if you put in the wrong therapy or something happens to the patient that has

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:21.780
these genetically engineered cells, there would be the opportunity to kill the cell.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:27.300
So this would be additional circuitry added on top of the genetic circuit to stop everything.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:33.460
And so these are some of the measures people look at for trying to mitigate some of these

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.340
risks.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:40.500
But at the same time, I mean, if you have a patient that is dying and they have

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:46.660
exhausted all other possibilities and there's a new cell therapy available that could give

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:53.060
them the chance to live longer or overcome the disease, I think then one has to take

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.100
that into account as well in making these calculations.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.340
Yeah, I guess it's very much context dependent.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.300
One thing I wanted to talk about, and then maybe we can move on towards the end of this

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.140
episode, was a paper that I read from you recently.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.460
It's about the internal model principle.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.180
I know it has little to do with the applications, but it's something that is very close to my

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.780
heart, something that I really, really like from classical control theory.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.300
And I thought it would be nice to touch on that as well before closing.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.180
Yeah, thanks for bringing this up.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.740
This is something I've been very excited about recently.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:34.820
So this is a paper, I guess the PNAS paper that you're referring to, appeared two or

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.540
three months ago.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:42.100
So what this work addresses, and this is, again, I was talking about having to develop

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:46.340
a new control theory that's particularly suited for biology, and this is a perfect

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.220
example of that.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:52.740
I guess as control people, we are taught early on at the graduate level what the internal

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:58.020
model principle of Francis and Wanam and, you know, the necessity of certain type of

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:03.140
structures, integral feedback, and so on for tracking and rejecting various types of disturbances.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:08.980
These systems, though, that were addressed by this work are mostly linear systems, and

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.380
they are not positive variables.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:15.860
They are not constrained by chemical reaction constraints.

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:18.020
And so in biology, the game is a little bit different.

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:24.500
Now, so for this particular work, we started by defining something called robust perfect

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.220
adaptation.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.860
This was available for the literature.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.660
We were not the first to introduce it, but it's a useful notion.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:37.620
Essentially, it means tracking and disturbance rejection at the steady state that is robust,

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.020
right?

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.380
So robust to what?

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:43.220
Robust to parameter changes, robust to topological changes in the network.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:50.580
And we know, for example, in the case of constant in time disturbances and signals, that integral

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:55.060
feedback is sufficient for such a robustness, and it's necessary for linear systems.

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:02.980
So how would one address this question if the underlying system is a bunch of molecules

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:05.300
interacting with each other through chemical reactions?

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.580
So they're positive variables.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.860
And what we were looking at is how do you define robustness in this case?

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:14.980
And we looked at the particularly strong notion of robustness.

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.860
We called it maximal robust perfect adaptation.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:22.820
In other words, the system has to be robust to changes in all the variables, all the parameters,

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:29.620
all the reaction rates, except for the ones that determine the set point, like the dial

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.940
that tunes in what the reference should be, right?

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.140
You can't be robust to that.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:34.820
Shouldn't be, even.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:38.260
So that's the maximal robust perfect adaptation.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.060
That's what it means.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:46.340
So what kind of biological networks allow you to do perfect tracking that is robust

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.740
to these kind of perturbations?

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.940
And we managed to obtain an answer.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:58.740
And the answer is different depending on whether this network is deterministic or it has noise.

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:04.100
So it's a stochastic network, with the stochastic network's controllers being more stringent.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:08.900
So all of the controllers that work for the stochastic network will work for the deterministic,

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.020
but not the other way around.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.460
There are motifs that will work for the noise-free case, that will not work, will break down

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.620
in the noisy case.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.020
For the noisy case, interestingly, we found that underlying all such motifs,

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.740
there is the antithetic motif at the heart as the main core component.

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:30.900
But more importantly, so we have an algebraic test, a very simple algebraic test.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.020
You give me the network.

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.180
I can apply, look at the certain matrix, and look at those properties.

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:42.420
And then from there, I can tell you whether this network has this adaptation property or not.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.100
And so that's one of the benefits.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:52.180
And if it does have this property, if it does adapt, I can construct the integrator,

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.180
which is usually not obvious.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:58.820
Very often, it's a way or a combination of molecules that interact with each other

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.020
in a certain way to implement this integral feedback.

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.180
And so this theory allows you to actually find the integrator,

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.660
which you wouldn't be able to do otherwise.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.980
So that's why I think this is kind of nice from a control theoretic point of view.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:19.460
It links in classical notions of internal model principles from Murray and Wanham

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:25.220
with sort of modern day biochemical reaction network theory.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.140
And we have a nice clean answer.

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:30.740
There's still a lot of open problems, but at least for this particular formulation

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:35.380
that I just described to you, the answer is clean and it's complete.

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:39.940
Oddly enough, I found that this revival of the, let's say,

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.580
an interest on the internal model principle has appeared in many different branches of

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:45.460
control theory.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:49.300
I've seen papers coming from the neuroscience aspects.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:54.820
Of course, many people in the motor control area are also very interested in this concept.

01:15:54.820 --> 01:16:00.740
And as a groupie, if you want, of this concept myself, I find it very exciting.

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.340
I think now is really the time to close this episode.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.660
It's going to be probably very long.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.860
So apologies to the audience, but it was, I hope, very interesting.

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.620
It was definitely very interesting to me.

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:17.060
And as I mentioned also to many other guests of the podcast,

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.660
I like to ask the question of advice to future students.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:24.900
So people that are interfacing with the idea of continuing in this field

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.940
or potentially venturing into the synthetic biology or cyber genetics field,

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.460
what is your best advice?

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.980
Okay, interesting.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.940
So I'm going to give probably a non-traditional advice,

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.020
but it's one I actually do believe in.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:47.460
And one that I was inspired by a quote from Richard Hamming.

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.020
I don't know if you know Richard Hamming or not, of course,

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.100
if you had an electrical engineering background.

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.700
A stroke of genius.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.020
Yeah.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.940
And he had the Hamming filter.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:59.700
He had also Hamming windows and Hamming codes and so on.

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.140
And he worked with Bell Labs.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.060
So Richard Hamming was interested in the creative process

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.260
and how people do research.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.300
And he actually wrote several articles on this.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:12.740
And one thing that specifically struck me is the following quote.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.580
Let's see if I can remember it.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:15.940
And he says something like this.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:16.260
He says,

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.660
Most scientists spend almost all of their time

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:26.020
working on problems that even they don't consider great,

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:30.020
nor do they consider these problems will lead to great work.

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:31.700
And so he says,

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.660
Then if you are working on unimportant problems,

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:37.140
you're not going to end up with important work,

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.860
except by the dumbest of luck.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:41.940
So this may seem trivial,

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.540
maybe obvious that, of course,

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.380
if you don't work on important problems,

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.340
you don't end up doing important work.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.540
But I think considering that many people

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.900
know that the problems they're working on are not important,

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:58.740
and I think it behooves us to give this more thought.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.580
So if you are starting,

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.100
if you're a new student that are starting to look for a PhD problem,

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.500
then I think it is useful to always ask yourself,

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:12.100
even though the problem that you're working on seems interesting,

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.860
and the solution approach is interesting,

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.060
and the tools are interesting,

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.980
how relevant would be the solution?

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.980
If you are to solve what you're trying to solve,

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.740
what would be the impact?

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.820
And if it's minimal,

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:30.340
maybe it's a chance to look for another problem that has a more impact.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.860
And I think really few people think about this.

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.780
Usually the way you end up working on certain problems by chance,

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.700
you talk to somebody, or you hear a talk,

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.020
and you say,

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.140
Ah, that sounds interesting.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.900
I can use this tool or that tool.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.620
And you get involved with the problem details,

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.380
and it's fun and exciting.

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.660
But at the end of the day,

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:52.100
is it relevant?

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.060
Is it important?

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:57.780
And I think it's a good idea to ask oneself every now and then,

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.340
Am I working on important problems?

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.020
There are always exciting tools and exciting approaches,

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.780
no matter what field you work on.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:11.460
So I think simply by addressing this question head on early,

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.500
I think one could, let's say,

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.940
have a better chance of having an impact once a solution is obtained.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.500
So that's my advice is, you know,

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.060
ask yourself, is this an important problem?

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.580
Because if it's not an important problem,

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.380
it's not likely to lead to important results.

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.180
I'm not saying it will for sure not lead to important,

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.540
which sometimes, you know, there is,

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.580
you might run into something that ends up being important.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.820
You didn't intend to solve that problem,

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.620
but you know, it's just serendipity kicks in, right?

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.900
Still, I think to the extent that you have an impact on what problems you choose,

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.820
I think it's a good idea to think about the potential impact of a solution.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.820
Well, Mustafa, with this, I think we can close this episode.
