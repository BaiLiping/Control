00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:23,000
Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,600
I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,840
Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Centre of Competence in Research of Dependable Ubiquitous

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,120
Automation and the International Federation of Automatic Control.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,560
Our guest today is Mustafa Kammasch, Professor of Control Theory and Systems Biology in the

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,320
Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
Welcome to the show, Mustafa.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,120
Glad to be here.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,200
Thanks for having me at your podcast, Alberto.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,520
Mustafa, let's jump right into it.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,800
What is cyber genetics?

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,320
Cyber genetics is actually a portmanteau of two words, cybernetics and genetics.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,160
And it's a term I came up with a few years ago because I got tired of saying all the

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,680
time research at the interface of systems and control theory and genetic engineering.

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,560
So it just seems much more fun and much more compact to just say cyber genetics.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,960
So essentially it is just that, it's a fusion of cybernetics, which is the term coined by

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:35,320
Norbert Wiener in 1948, which aims to study control and communication in the human and

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,880
in the machine under the same umbrella.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,680
And it has a more modern feature, which is the genetics part.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,480
As you see, at the time of Norbert Wiener, 1948, the structure of DNA hasn't even been

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,280
discovered yet.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,600
And so much of the work that went on in cybernetics had more to do with things like neuroscience,

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,860
maybe diseases that had to do with neuromuscular sources.

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,240
But nowadays we have much more powerful tools.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,340
We have much more powerful genetic tools and we could do so much more.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,960
And so you can imagine now we can bring this cybernetics to a new level.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,820
So that's what I mean when I say cyber genetics.

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,300
Yeah, that's a fantastic definition.

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,060
I might ask, what is a gene actually?

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,220
What do we mean by that?

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,780
And what do we mean by genetics?

33
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,860
What are the goals there?

34
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,540
Yeah, I think a gene is essentially the basic hereditary units.

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,480
You know, very simply, you can think of a gene as corresponding to a single protein.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,660
It's not exactly like that.

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,820
It's not always like that, but I think this is good enough.

38
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:58,340
And so each gene is a stretch of DNA encoded using nucleotides on DNA.

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,240
And when that stretch is expressed, the outcome is a single protein.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,880
This protein goes on to interact with other proteins or maybe with other genes to implement

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,880
various different functions.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,120
I guess there it would be useful to have a small primer on how biology works and how

43
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,680
DNA is used in biology or in biological systems.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,900
Yeah, so of course DNA is central to life.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,840
In its sequences are encoded, you know, all the biological functions that the organism

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
requires.

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,480
It's extremely dense with information.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,620
And so you can think about DNA as encoding all the information needed for the biological

49
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,140
processes required for life.

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,700
But it's not only a storage device, because DNA itself is a molecule and it interacts

51
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:57,960
with other proteins through which this interaction regulates the amount of gene expression.

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,000
So gene expression is a term that comes up repeatedly, and you mentioned something about

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
it.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,040
So it consists of two different processes.

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,700
The first one is transcription, and the second one is translation.

56
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,400
So transcription is the process by which the DNA is read inside the cell.

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,060
And the outcome of this transcription process is messenger RNA.

58
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:31,540
So you have a messenger RNA that then goes on to be translated by cellular machines called

59
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:38,900
ribosomes, and the outcome of that process, of that translation process, is these proteins.

60
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,500
Usually you have a sequence of amino acids that then folds into a secondary structure

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,340
or a tertiary structure, and once it's fully folded, then it's called a protein, and that's

62
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
when it's functional.

63
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,740
And by functional, I mean, you know, it can interact with other proteins, with other RNAs,

64
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,820
with other genes, to do all the wonderful things that the cell has to do to exist.

65
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,260
I guess that maybe at this point already, someone in the audience will think, am I listening

66
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,620
to the right podcast?

67
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,940
But you mentioned so many words that come from engineering.

68
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,460
So you mentioned regulation, you mentioned machines, you literally called ribosomes machines,

69
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,940
you mentioned interaction, which is so key in our field.

70
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,300
So what is the role of control theory here, and what does it have to do with biology?

71
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,420
Actually, control is very native to biology.

72
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:43,940
In fact, biological systems discovered control billions of years before we did,

73
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,380
and they have been employing it in different flavors, different levels of organization,

74
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
much longer than we have.

75
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,700
And so it's not really an exaggeration to say that much of the complexity of biological

76
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,980
systems have to do with the requirements of regulation.

77
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,180
And that's because regulation, or what biologists call regulation, what we also call control,

78
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,100
exists at every level of organization in biology, from the molecular level, to the cellular level,

79
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,860
to the tissue level, to the organism level, even to the ecological level.

80
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,740
And so if you look at the typical biological systems, you will very quickly find tons and

81
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,420
tons of feedback loops, feedforward loops that are helping the cells achieve their various

82
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,060
functions in a very robust fashion.

83
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:42,100
So really, it's quite natural to be doing control in biology, because as I said, much

84
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,380
of the complexity of biology is about regulation.

85
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,620
Or comes from this regulation.

86
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,220
Yeah.

87
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,260
And I was actually looking at your biography, you know, in doing my homework for this podcast,

88
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,780
and you're natively a control theorist, but you then moved, ventured, if you want, in

89
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,260
this field.

90
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,220
And so I was wondering what has drawn your attention from being a very theoretical person

91
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,100
who was working into deep questions in robust control towards this fascinating field?

92
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,580
Yeah, that's a very good question.

93
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,700
Actually, thinking back at those times, this was in the late 90s.

94
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,980
So I was working on robust control for my PhD thesis, and the early and mid into the

95
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,700
late 90s, I was still working on robust control.

96
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,020
But by that time, really, the main problems in robust control have been solved.

97
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,740
So the H-infinity problems, state space solutions, Turicati equation problem has been solved.

98
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,260
And there wasn't much left in terms of, you know, big problems.

99
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,100
And at the same time, around the same time, my wife had our second child.

100
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,620
And after childbirth, she had the problems with her thyroid gland.

101
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,340
So she was going through a period of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

102
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,180
So the thyroid hormones were essentially oscillating like crazy.

103
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,900
And I had no idea what was going on.

104
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,780
So I went to the library and I picked up a textbook on endocrinology.

105
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,420
Endocrinology is a science of hormones and their actions.

106
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,740
And really, this was a very transformative moment because I was shocked by what I was

107
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,620
reading.

108
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,580
Everything in that book seemed like it's a control theory without equations, right?

109
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,340
So there's one exquisite feedback loop after the other, doing all kinds of different things,

110
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,340
but of course, no equations.

111
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,020
So I was really fascinated by this.

112
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,100
And that led me to go to the National Animal Disease Center at Iowa State University, where

113
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,620
I was at the time in the US.

114
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,420
And I talked to one of the physiologists and I said, you know, I'm a control theorist.

115
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,180
Please, can you give me a problem where you think control theory could be useful?

116
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,180
And it was very naive, but actually, it turned out he gave me a fantastic problem.

117
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:09,140
He gave me a problem that he was working on that had to do with how mammals, in his particular

118
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,660
case, dairy cows, regulate their blood calcium.

119
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:22,100
So us humans and other mammals, we have a very tight regulation of calcium in the blood

120
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,580
plasma.

121
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,140
This is important because calcium ions are needed for muscle function, nerve function,

122
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,300
blood clotting, signal communications, and so on.

123
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,580
So it's a very important biochemical role.

124
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,020
And because of that, we have evolved a very elaborate control system to maintain the

125
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,700
concentration at about 9 milligrams per deciliter.

126
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,500
So it's really a fascinating problem, and it could have been a better problem to start

127
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,740
with.

128
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,460
In that case, they were looking at a specific disease that dairy cows had that humans don't

129
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,100
usually have.

130
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,220
It's called milk fever.

131
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,220
And it turned out to be some kind of a dynamic instability in the closed-loop system that

132
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,580
was induced by the way humans breed cows to make more and more and more milk.

133
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:16,660
And so myself and another young master's students that I had, we had a lot of fun

134
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,860
working out the details.

135
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,340
And when all the dust settled, we had discovered that mammals regulate their blood calcium

136
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,700
by using proportional integral feedback.

137
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,820
It's as simple as that.

138
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,500
So that was kind of a nice discovery.

139
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,300
All the ingredients and the elements were there in terms of the main players, the hormones

140
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,260
and their interactions.

141
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,460
It just waited for somebody with a control perspective to explain what these interactions

142
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,580
were actually doing.

143
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,780
Well, you probably didn't have any mathematical model for studying this phenomenon, or was

144
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,140
there actually any?

145
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,900
Did you have to develop everything from scratch?

146
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,460
We didn't have any mathematical model, but we developed a very, very simple model, actually.

147
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Just looking at the blood volume as a constant volume and looking at various sources for

148
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,580
calciums and various sinks, and then making simple arguments like, you know, disturbance

149
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,660
looks like an outflux of calcium.

150
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,780
And then we know the system regulates with zero steady-state tracking error, so the

151
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,100
controller must have such and such properties.

152
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,900
And so the model we used actually was very simple, maybe a second-order model.

153
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,500
Only when we were looking at the specific disease did we have to go to more complicated

154
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,300
nonlinearities.

155
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,100
And even then, there were saturation-type nonlinearities, which were very naturally

156
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,780
justified based on the nature of the disease that we were working with.

157
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,420
So basically, third-order linear systems with saturation nonlinearities.

158
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,100
That was sufficient to explain the whole story.

159
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,500
Of course, one can develop more complicated models with different compartments and so

160
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,060
on, but I think for the purposes that we needed it, this was sufficient.

161
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,180
And the essence was there.

162
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,820
And so that was your, let's say, initial start in this world of systems and synthetic

163
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,220
biology.

164
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,700
Actually, may I ask, what is the difference between the two fields, between synthetic

165
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,140
biology and systems biology?

166
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,900
That's a very good question.

167
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,220
I get asked this question a lot.

168
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,460
I think, you know, one analogy would be it's similar to the difference between system theory

169
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,420
and control theory.

170
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:35,620
So systems biology aims to analyze existing biological networks, and it's some kind of

171
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,100
reverse engineering, if you will.

172
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,740
So you have a network that's functional, you have a cell that's doing a certain thing,

173
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,300
you're trying to understand why it does what it does.

174
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,260
And when it fails, why it fails.

175
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,620
And so you kind of ask questions about a network that already exists.

176
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,660
Now, synthetic biology does things a little bit differently.

177
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
So it's more like a forward engineering.

178
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,340
How can we modify this network?

179
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:10,100
How can we add additional components so that it either achieves new function or it fixes

180
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,660
the function that somehow was broken, right?

181
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,580
So if there's a disease and then you add a new element into your cells to kind of cure

182
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,340
that disease, this would be more on the forward engineering part.

183
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
So I think that's really the main difference.

184
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,540
It's like adding the synthesis aspect to a systems biology.

185
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,060
In our language, the former would be analysis, dealing with analysis, and the second would

186
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,100
be dealing with design.

187
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,620
So they go hand in hand, they're complementary.

188
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,260
That's a very good way of saying it.

189
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,300
Also, synthetic biology can be used for analysis.

190
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,380
So for example, let's say you have a hypothesis about a biological system, you think it works

191
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,140
in a certain way, and then you go build it in the lab.

192
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,740
And if it doesn't function the way it's supposed to function, then you have to adjust

193
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,620
your understanding.

194
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:08,020
And so one can also think of synthetic biology as sort of a field that allows you to tinker

195
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,020
and get a deeper understanding of the underlying science, not only just to build new things.

196
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,660
And this is reminiscent of another Feynman quote, building his understanding that appeared

197
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,020
on this podcast before.

198
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah.

199
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
What I cannot build, I do not understand.

200
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,700
Exactly, exactly.

201
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,260
Exactly, yeah.

202
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,420
That's an often quoted quote by Richard Feynman, a synthetic biologist.

203
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,060
Yeah.

204
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,700
I think it captures the essence quite well.

205
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,860
Actually, yeah, I was looking at the history of synthetic biology, and it seems to be extremely

206
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,620
recent, at least, you know, the year 2000 seems to be the turning point in this field.

207
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,980
Of course, there are predecessors, but in 2000, there were, I believe, three really

208
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,860
milestone papers on nature where people actually implemented biological circuits that essentially

209
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,220
implemented a switch.

210
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,820
Another one would implement an oscillator, and another circuit would implement a feedback

211
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,860
mechanism, essentially.

212
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,060
So all three in the same year.

213
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,180
It's incredible.

214
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,820
That's right.

215
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,020
Even in the same journal.

216
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,900
Exactly right.

217
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,540
So there were three milestone papers that essentially demonstrated what you said.

218
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,420
One can think of these circuits in the following way.

219
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,220
One of them used one gene, and the second one used two genes, and the third one used

220
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,300
three genes, and they all had negative feedback.

221
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,900
So when you have negative feedback with one gene, you have an auto-regulatory circuit,

222
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,700
so that's the usual feedback systems that we like.

223
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,300
When you have two genes, each having negative feedback on each other, you have positive

224
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,780
feedback, and that's what implements, by stability in this case, a toggle switch.

225
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,180
And the third had, you know, three genes, each repressing the other in a sort of a

226
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,860
ring-type fashion.

227
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,460
So then you get a ring oscillator.

228
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,060
And yeah, that's a work of Michael Elowitz.

229
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,260
Those are the three classic papers that kicked the field into motion.

230
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:08,900
And in fact, the tools of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, the most important tool,

231
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,900
they were already available in the 70s and 80s, and many biologists actually have done

232
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,020
synthetic constructs.

233
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:22,820
But I think in the year 2000, people were thinking of this field more like VLSI circuit

234
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,460
design, right?

235
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,660
So you can build circuits and devices that then you can put together into functional

236
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,300
units.

237
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,180
And this is a distinctly engineering approach.

238
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,740
It's no longer just tinkering with one gene or another to see what happens, but it's

239
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,780
actually with a purpose to build more complex systems.

240
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,260
And here we are, what, 23 years later, and, you know, we're still struggling with a lot

241
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,620
of these designs.

242
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,780
We can build more complicated circuits now.

243
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,580
Instead of one or two genes, we can build circuits with tens of genes.

244
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,900
But there's still lots of challenges.

245
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,380
So I think the field is still in its infancy.

246
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,860
A huge promise, of course, but lots of challenges.

247
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:11,300
So I think for researchers who want to work in this field, I think this is a very good

248
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,340
time to be doing it.

249
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,260
There's a lot to unpack in what you just mentioned.

250
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,420
I don't know where to start.

251
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,180
One of the things that made me think when you were elaborating on your thoughts was

252
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:30,740
that you touched on so many elementary components that are very familiar to the area of

253
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,300
computing.

254
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,700
So switches, oscillators.

255
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,900
So in hearing about these concepts, what I think about is a computer.

256
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,980
So it seems like it's possible to assemble some sort of biological computer out of those

257
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,540
components.

258
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,140
The second thing that I'm extremely excited about is what we can actually do with these

259
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,540
circuits.

260
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,500
So the ones that you just mentioned and what is actually the time horizon in which we can

261
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,460
hope to see something, let's say, in our lifetime.

262
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,500
Is it going to be in two centuries, a millennia?

263
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,140
Who knows?

264
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,340
And the third thing that I would like to ask you is what are the main developments in the

265
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,980
middle, let's say from 2000 to today?

266
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,300
So what happened in between?

267
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,540
Okay, so starting from the last part of your question, so what happened in between?

268
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,860
I think that what happened is people started to build more complex circuits.

269
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,340
And in the process, they ran into challenges.

270
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,980
So there are various challenges when you're working with biological substrates that one

271
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,380
does not find when working with electric circuits.

272
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,500
Interestingly, a lot of people working in this field, synthetic and systems, synthetic

273
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,100
biology in particular, have a background in physics or engineering and so on.

274
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,580
So the electric circuit analogy has been a running theme throughout.

275
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,580
And I think while this analogy had served the field well early on, I don't personally

276
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:07,780
think it's any longer a useful analogy to continue to pursue for reasons we can discuss

277
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,260
if you want.

278
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,820
But the idea there was, you know, you want to modularize everything.

279
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,580
So you want to build functional units that then you can combine together with other units

280
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,620
in series or in parallel and be able to scale up that way.

281
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,500
But biology didn't play well with this vision.

282
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,380
There are many issues.

283
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,420
For example, when you're doing electric circuits, communication or information is

284
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:40,980
transmitted through conduits, wires that are very, very precise, and only the parts

285
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,740
that talk to each other generally talk to each other, right?

286
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,580
I mean, of course, you could have electromagnetic interference and so on, but most circuits

287
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,620
don't have these issues.

288
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,860
In biology, it's not like this.

289
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,820
You know, all the molecules see all the other molecules.

290
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,980
So the way you would transmit information is through specificity.

291
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,860
You know, molecule A binds to molecule B.

292
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,540
Maybe it binds molecule C a little bit, but really it's molecule B that it needs to

293
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,180
interact with.

294
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,700
So you end up with a lot of crosstalk like this.

295
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,740
So that's one problem.

296
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,580
Another problem is noise or stochasticity.

297
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,340
So when you're working with electric circuits, you have your Ohm's law, you have your

298
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,540
ordinary differential equations, or, you know, everything is more or less deterministic.

299
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,020
Of course, one can still talk about shot noise and so on at various frequencies.

300
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,780
But in biology, it's not like this at all.

301
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,380
So molecules very often come in very low copy numbers.

302
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,860
So you have one gene, for example, a handful of mRNAs, and these interactions between these

303
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,420
low copy numbers species, they're random in nature.

304
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,300
Molecule A interacts with molecule B only if they happen to bind, collide with each

305
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,800
other.

306
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,620
But maybe in the process or before that happens, molecule A interacts with molecule C first,

307
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,580
and then some other reaction takes place.

308
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,700
So really, the timing and order of chemical reactions when you have very low copy numbers

309
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,900
is random.

310
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,340
So this should be compared with what you've learned in chemistry in high school, where

311
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,780
things are present in very large copy numbers, Avogadro's numbers in a test tube, where

312
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,620
none of this is true.

313
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,180
So you can actually approximate or you can safely describe the dynamics using ordinary

314
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,140
differential equations.

315
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,300
They're nonlinear, but, you know, that come from mass action kinetics or other type of

316
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,780
kinetics.

317
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:45,780
But in the end of the day, you get deterministic equations that represent continuous variables

318
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,300
that describe the different concentrations of the different reactions, but not so inside

319
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,980
the living cell where the copy numbers is low and the randomness is ever present.

320
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:05,940
So a more suitable tool in this case is to look at, instead of continuous variables that

321
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,260
evolve deterministically, you look at stochastic or random variables to represent the number

322
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:19,540
of molecules for each of the different proteins or RNAs and the stochastic nature in which

323
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,700
these random variables evolve.

324
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,780
So really, the typical model that we work with in this case is a continuous time discrete

325
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,780
state Markov process, and that's a much better representation of what's going on inside

326
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,900
the living cell, especially when you have very low copy numbers.

327
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,100
So noise is another big problem that one has to deal with.

328
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,820
Of course, nonlinearity as well, because everything is nonlinear when you have chemical reactions.

329
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:52,660
And so a wealth of mathematical as well as computational problems to deal with.

330
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:53,780
Yeah.

331
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,940
So what you just said, essentially you replied to a question that I wanted to ask you, which

332
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,180
would be what are the challenges in controlling biomolecular systems?

333
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,620
And to me, it seems like the scale in a way determines also the way you describe the processes

334
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,820
that you're interested.

335
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,340
As you said, there seems to be a fundamental difference between electrical circuits and

336
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,900
biomolecular, if you want, systems.

337
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,220
So, and I wonder what is the role of control engineering there?

338
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,860
So what can we hope to achieve?

339
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,860
What is the current progress there?

340
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
And where are we going towards?

341
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,180
I mean, I think I don't want to give the impression that one must only use these stochastic models,

342
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,220
otherwise nothing works.

343
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,060
Because depending on the problem that you're looking at and the scale that you're looking

344
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,820
at, very often deterministic ordinary differential equations can still serve as good models for

345
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,940
biological phenomena.

346
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,140
Just one has to be careful that when you're looking inside the cell, especially smaller

347
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,820
cells like bacteria, this assumption may be violated and you may end up with behaviors

348
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,780
that are very different.

349
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,100
Very often, actually, the most suitable approach is a hybrid one, where you have some variables

350
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:11,300
that are stochastic and discrete, others are continuous and evolved deterministically,

351
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,900
and they interact with each other.

352
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,060
So, you know, this is probably the most useful model.

353
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,380
So what control problems exist?

354
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,740
Even if one sticks to the deterministic framework, and let's talk about this first, the issues

355
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,420
that I mentioned before, crosstalk is one of them, you would like to do regulation,

356
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,820
you'd like to regulate certain variables, and these variables, for example, must track

357
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:44,260
certain set points or reject certain disturbances, so you end up with a control problem.

358
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,820
You know, how do you design a feedback or feedforward mechanism that will implement

359
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,420
this or that would meet these control specifications?

360
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,740
So what is so challenging about biology?

361
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,660
Well, for one thing, again, we're sticking even to deterministic descriptions, all the

362
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,820
variables are positive variables.

363
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,980
So whatever you want to do, it has to be done with positive quantities, right?

364
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,100
So positive systems.

365
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,260
I mean, that's one of the main challenges.

366
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:20,100
The functions that you build, the controllers that you have to synthesize, you cannot just

367
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,700
write a transfer function and just say, please build me this transfer function, you know,

368
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,460
or this nonlinear function.

369
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,020
You are constrained by chemical reactions.

370
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,380
So everything that you want to implement, your controller, for example, has to be implementable

371
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,420
using biochemical reactions, right?

372
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,820
So that also adds a second constraint.

373
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,500
And it's the interplay of these two constraints, the positivity of the variables plus the

374
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,620
constraints that are imposed by the type of interactions you can have inside a living

375
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,260
cell, I think give biology the distinctive flavor that it has.

376
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,940
And it opens up a wealth of problems in control theory.

377
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,620
What kind of controllers can you build using these chemical reactions?

378
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,380
How would you achieve, let's say, perfect tracking, robust steady state tracking with

379
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,660
these type of controllers and these type of networks?

380
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,180
They have to be positive, they have to be implementable, realizable as a chemical reaction.

381
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,060
Can you realize any transfer function, or can you approximate it using biochemical reactions?

382
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:28,260
So there's really a wealth of problems that control theory can contribute to.

383
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,220
And I'm not saying that existing control theory can address these things, and that's really

384
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,500
the beauty of this, is that it's not just, you know, here, I'm just going to move the

385
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,220
methods that people have already developed in our field and just apply them to control

386
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,580
theory, to biology.

387
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,860
That would be the wrong approach.

388
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,340
I think one has to be open-minded, and you look at the problems that emerge in biology,

389
00:26:52,340 --> 00:27:01,940
and more often than not, you have to develop a new control theory that is suited for biology.

390
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,980
And I think that's even more fun that way.

391
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,140
So that's what we do in my lab.

392
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:14,020
We try to develop a control theory, a new foundation for control theory at the molecular

393
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:20,340
scale, and then we also try to build these chemical reaction mechanisms using genetic

394
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,300
engineering tools.

395
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:29,220
And so I think for me, at least, the challenging part is also the most fun and interesting

396
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,420
part, is where the theory and the experiments meet.

397
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,980
The theoretical questions are motivated by the experimental considerations, and the experiments

398
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,140
we do are always guided or informed by the theory we develop.

399
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,900
And there's this interaction, very close interaction, that I think is just, you know,

400
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,820
every time theory impacts the experiment, I really get a kick out of this in the lab.

401
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:02,340
And I think that's sitting at the boundary between the experimental world and the control

402
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,660
theoretic world is really a very good place to be, at least for me.

403
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,500
It sounds incredibly interesting.

404
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,300
I just want to comment on what you mentioned before about the constraints, if you want,

405
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,580
that biology imposes.

406
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,580
So maybe just to clarify the fact that all variables need to be positive, I guess that's

407
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,780
because we're always talking about concepts that are quantified quantities of things that

408
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,540
are out there, or I guess fluxes or other...

409
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,260
Concentrations.

410
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,780
Concentrations, exactly.

411
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:37,860
So it's incredible how positive system theory there has a huge role.

412
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,740
And the second thing that I wanted to mention is related to the question of realization

413
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,780
that you mentioned before.

414
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,460
I find it very fascinating that in this context, you're very much constrained, as you mentioned

415
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,660
by chemistry.

416
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,180
And so the realization theory, if you want, that you can build out of these systems has

417
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,620
to comply with those rules.

418
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,260
And I guess it imposes huge constraints because everything has to comply with the law of mass

419
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,940
action or with those nonlinear equations.

420
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,780
And therefore, it's very, very different from, again, the world, the realm of electricity.

421
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,380
But I also thought that maybe this is actually a good point, as you mentioned about the work

422
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,100
of your lab, to shift gears and to start talking about motifs.

423
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:30,100
And one of the motifs that your lab has developed, which I find incredibly interesting, as a

424
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,220
preview to the listeners, we're going to talk about one of the first PI controllers, if

425
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,100
not the first, I'm not sure about it, but I think it's the first, in biomolecular systems.

426
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,220
And this is something that gets me incredibly excited about the future of this branch of

427
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,820
control theory and systems and synthetic biology.

428
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,700
Yeah, so biologists like to talk about motifs.

429
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,460
That's not a word that exists, I guess, or is commonly used in our field in control

430
00:29:59,460 --> 00:29:59,860
theory.

431
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,820
So let me just explain what a motif is.

432
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:10,340
So a motif is usually just a pattern that recurs with a frequency that is much higher

433
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,660
than one would expect if it were by chance.

434
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,300
So you could have a motif in terms of a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA that repeats.

435
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,140
What we're more interested in is network motifs.

436
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,420
And so these are simple network elements that implement a certain function that you

437
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,260
usually see much more frequently than chance, such that this small network forms a basis

438
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,300
for much more complex biological behavior.

439
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,220
So one example of that is a feedback loop.

440
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,460
So that would be a simple network motif, or a feedforward loop, or let's say an oscillator,

441
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,900
or a positive feedback loop.

442
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,340
So those are the different motifs.

443
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:58,100
When I first joined ETH in 2011, before actually joining, I was just doing purely systems biology,

444
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,940
so more analysis, system theory.

445
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,860
Now coming to ETH, I had the opportunity to start my own lab.

446
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,780
I have to say, before that, I hadn't touched a test tube in my life.

447
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,300
So it was a bit of an experience to kind of try to learn all of these techniques and build

448
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
a wet lab from scratch.

449
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,660
But I already had tenure.

450
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,460
I had nothing to lose.

451
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,220
And so if it didn't work, I would just close it.

452
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,180
That's the way you do it.

453
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,380
Continue doing theory as usual.

454
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,700
And that was one of the best decisions I had made, actually, professionally, is to start

455
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,260
a wet lab.

456
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,300
Initially, I thought I would just have one bench with one student, maybe doing some experiments

457
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,860
to verify the theory.

458
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,500
Right now, I have more than 16 different benches, and my group is actually more than half people

459
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,380
doing experiments.

460
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,300
So it's been a really very rewarding experience.

461
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,940
We didn't do it at the expense of theory.

462
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,660
We just sort of just added to the theoretical work and gave it much more color and life

463
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,620
and meaning.

464
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,820
And also to the theoretical questions that we ask are now very different, because they're

465
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,980
driven by what we see in the lab.

466
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:17,060
So having the ability to do experiments meant to me that now I can switch from doing system

467
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,620
theory to doing control theory.

468
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,140
So now we could do synthesis.

469
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,580
It didn't really make much sense to do synthesis if you're just doing analyzing existing systems.

470
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,860
Now, suppose you would like to design a new feature or you would like to control a living

471
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,380
cell in one way or another.

472
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:42,740
We started by using a technique that had been developed earlier called optogenetics, namely

473
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,860
developing cells that are actually sensitive to light so that you can actually control

474
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,660
them by shining light with different intensities.

475
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,980
That was the earlier problem.

476
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,740
So we would control, we would still use computer controllers, but the computer controllers

477
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:05,540
would send out signals that are light signals whose intensities actually serve as the actuation.

478
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,620
That was fun, and we actually were able to build the first feedback control system.

479
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,100
The computer controlled the gene expression at the time.

480
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
This was 2011.

481
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:25,940
But then another experience that I had in the past, namely integral feedback, came to

482
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,500
the front.

483
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,900
And the question was, can we build integral feedback controllers inside living cells?

484
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,660
You know, having shown that these systems naturally exist, for example, in calcium and

485
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,340
many other systems, it was obvious to ask the question, how would you build one?

486
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,820
Nobody had built integral feedback controllers.

487
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,300
And then, you know, we started trying to build a system that mimics the calcium homeostasis,

488
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,220
and we spent a lot of time on it, several years, two or three years, not really very

489
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,940
successfully.

490
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:07,220
One time, we thought we had it, and it was exhibiting zero steady state tracking errors,

491
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,140
everything that an integrator should do.

492
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,820
But to our disappointment, it was actually an artifact.

493
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,380
We discovered it was a biological artifact, and what we are seeing was not really the

494
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,220
action of an integral feedback controller.

495
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:25,220
It was a combination of negative feedback with disturbance feedforward that was behaving

496
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,100
very much like what an integrator would do.

497
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,860
And this went on for quite a while, and then I think the breakthrough came from the theory

498
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,180
side.

499
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,540
We had come up with a new motif that, which now we call, I called it the antithetic motif

500
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,780
for a reason that has to do with the way the molecules interact with each other.

501
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:55,220
So this antithetic motif, on paper, should be able to implement or realize integral feedback.

502
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,860
And it required two molecules, and you know, you can do negative variables by having two

503
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,340
positive variables and look at their difference, essentially.

504
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:11,780
And so this motif is a kind of a sequestration or annihilation motif, to use the term we

505
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,900
like to use in biology.

506
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,420
But essentially, two molecules bind with each other, and they prevent each other from being

507
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,220
active.

508
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,900
And one can use that behavior to realize integral feedback control systems.

509
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,900
And so the theory was nice.

510
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,100
And in fact, it turns out that these type of integral feedback controllers are also

511
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,980
noise resistant.

512
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,780
So they allow us to solve this problem with stochasticity or noise.

513
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,900
In fact, they would exploit noise so that they would function better in the presence

514
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,380
of noise.

515
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,020
Whereas if the system was noise-free, one would observe oscillations.

516
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,140
Now the presence of noise would actually lead to a dampening of this oscillation.

517
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,500
Very counterintuitive, but one can prove this mathematically.

518
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,420
And so then there was a sudden and abrupt switch in the lab.

519
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,260
Okay, drop everything that you're doing with these other systems.

520
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,220
Let's now try to implement these antithetic controllers.

521
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,900
It still took a good year and a half to two years to build them and verify that they were

522
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,460
functional.

523
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,780
But in fact, because we had to find the right biological molecules that had the behavior

524
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,460
that we were looking for, and it was a very stringent constraint.

525
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,620
You know, these molecules have to sequester each other.

526
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:32,340
Once they're bound, they could not function anymore to actuate.

527
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,300
And so we found them in the form of what's called sigma factors that exist already in

528
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:37,860
biology.

529
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,780
Once we built it, we could verify that we actually have an integral feedback controller

530
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,420
on our hands.

531
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:51,220
And I think these were very happy times because it really, from beginning to end, it took

532
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,220
a good part of seven years to build that first integral feedback controller.

533
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,740
But it was a glorious moment when this finally worked.

534
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,980
The paper appeared in Nature in 2019.

535
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:10,900
Now, to 2023, you know, we can build many of these, let's say one every two or three

536
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,420
months, with much better properties, better dynamic range.

537
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,380
It works in mammalian cells and bacterial cells.

538
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,020
So, you know, once we had that first integrator, we started learning about its property and

539
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,060
how to optimize it.

540
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,100
We have advanced quite a lot since then.

541
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,140
That must have felt like a real eureka moment, almost like in Harold Black developing the

542
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,660
negative feedback amplifier.

543
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:42,980
At least for me, it was, you know, the culmination of a lot of attempts, failed attempts and

544
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,780
a lot of effort.

545
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:51,380
For people in the lab, it was salvation because they no longer had to keep doing these experiments

546
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,420
that would take a long time.

547
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,660
You see, when you want to do, let's say, a simple time course, you know, and if you're

548
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,620
building a circuit, you know, you put a scope, a oscilloscope, and then you look at the voltage

549
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,260
up and you see whether steady state is achieved or not.

550
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,980
In biology, you know, steady state happens after 10 hours.

551
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:15,460
And so if you want to do a time course, then you have to do samples every so often during

552
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,580
this time course, and you have to do all sorts of dilution processes and freezing of these

553
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,940
samples and so on just to get one trace, only to find out that it hasn't worked for one

554
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,740
reason or another.

555
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,140
So it was a very grueling experience for people in the lab.

556
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:39,220
And when the new theory was developed, there was another small gift that came with this

557
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:47,860
theory, and that is that we could show that in the presence of noise, this motif is the

558
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,500
only motif that will implement integral feedback.

559
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,780
So this is kind of a necessary condition.

560
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:00,180
And the reason why this was good news for the experimentalists is just a realization

561
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,980
that this is the right motif.

562
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,260
We're not missing another motif that could have done this easier.

563
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,900
If it is to work, this is the only way it would work, right?

564
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:18,420
So this was completely reassuring, and it was just a matter of time when they got the

565
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,500
circuits to actually work the way we were expecting that they would work.

566
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,460
This is incredibly exciting, at least for me as a follower of this story.

567
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,260
It's fantastic.

568
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,540
I would like to dissect so many of the things that we touched on just in the last few minutes,

569
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:40,820
because we inadvertently touched on the enabling technologies that allowed this Eureka moment

570
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,380
to happen.

571
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,540
We also touched on the concept of antithetic integral feedback that I would like to dig

572
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,900
into a little bit more.

573
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,300
Yeah, maybe we can start from the former.

574
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,980
Initially, you were speaking about optogenetics, which, pun intended, allowed you to shed new

575
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,380
light on these biomolecular phenomena.

576
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,420
Maybe we can talk about the enabling technologies that allowed control theory to actually

577
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,180
implement these circuits.

578
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,820
Yeah, I think when I think of cybergenetics, at least the way I've thought about it, when

579
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:23,780
coming up with ways to do cellular control, one can think of two different flavors, right?

580
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,300
So general flavors.

581
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,900
One flavor, which is using computers to control living cells, so computers in the loop.

582
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,740
There, implementing any control system you like is easy and possible.

583
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,820
The challenge there is to interface the computer with the cell.

584
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,580
So what do you need for that?

585
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Well, you need sensors and you need actuators.

586
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,620
In terms of the sensors, we would like to measure what the cell is doing.

587
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,460
Let's say how much gene is expressed.

588
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,860
I mean, this problem had been worked out.

589
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,700
There was a topic of a Nobel Prize 2008 in chemistry.

590
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,780
That's the well-known fluorescent protein, the discovery of the green fluorescent protein.

591
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,700
The main idea there is very simple.

592
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,380
If you have a protein that's being expressed by your gene, what you do is you genetically

593
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,740
engineer your gene such that, in addition to that protein, it fuses another protein

594
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,100
that fluoresces.

595
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,300
So when that original protein is expressed, attached to it is another fluorescent protein.

596
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,620
And by measuring the intensity of this fluorescence, you get an idea about the abundance of the

597
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,420
expressed protein.

598
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,260
And so that's one way to measure.

599
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:35,140
Initially, this was green fluorescent protein, but I think it wasn't long before other colors

600
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,940
where other wavelengths were developed.

601
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,460
And so one can look at multiple proteins simultaneously.

602
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,740
So you can do even multivariable control if you want.

603
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,340
But still very challenging with a single output.

604
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,100
So the idea, though, we can measure protein abundances.

605
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,460
So that solves the problem of sensing.

606
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,500
For that, you could either have your cells under a microscope, and then you would image

607
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,020
it, and you would, you know, see how much fluorescence that your cells have and quantify

608
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,260
that.

609
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,940
Or there's another device called a flow cytometer, which allows you to put a cell through a

610
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,820
microfluidic channel, shine a laser on it, see how much fluorescence.

611
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,220
So you can count the fluorescence of each individual cell, and you could do this for

612
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,380
hundreds of thousands of cells a minute.

613
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,100
So you can get a nice distribution for your population.

614
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,060
You can think of this as a snapshot of the probability density function of the expression.

615
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,140
So you can measure, you feed that to the computer, and then to actuate was a problem.

616
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,860
So how would we tell the cells how to express, how much to express based on what the computer

617
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,340
computes?

618
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,420
There, I think we found optogenetics.

619
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,380
And that was a technique that has been developed recently.

620
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,380
At the time, it was recent.

621
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,140
I guess now it's no longer recent.

622
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:58,260
So it allows cells to be light sensitive so that the more light you shine on the cell,

623
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,740
the more the gene is expressed.

624
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,340
OK, so this is an actuator.

625
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:08,260
We had since developed our own optogenetic systems in bacteria, in yeast, and in mammalian

626
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,020
cells that are particularly suited for control applications.

627
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,140
But at the time, we just used what was already out there, and it was sufficient.

628
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,260
Now you could do sensing, you could do actuation, and you can close the feedback loop with a

629
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,980
computer in the loop, and then you can control gene expression, which is something we managed

630
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,740
to do in 2011.

631
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:35,860
Since then, we've been using this technology to control cells in a bioreactor so that we

632
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,060
can optimize various protein products and various other applications.

633
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,780
So this is one flavor where the computer is in the loop.

634
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:49,940
The other flavor, which is actually in many ways is a bit harder, would be the controller

635
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,540
is in the cell, right?

636
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:58,260
So you have to genetically engineer the control system so that once you have a genetically

637
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,940
modified cell, when the genes, modified genes are expressed, they produce proteins that

638
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:09,540
interact with each other in a way that realizes your control system.

639
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,180
So this is what we had to do with the integral controller.

640
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:18,660
We had to modify genetically the cells, in that case it was E. coli at the time, so that

641
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,820
they express these sigma factors that aren't normally there in that particular bacterium.

642
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,540
It comes from another bacterium.

643
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:34,820
And such that when these proteins are expressed, they implement this antithetic motif and in

644
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,580
the process close the feedback loop.

645
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,180
So that's the genetically engineered controls.

646
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,460
And that's the second flavor of a feedback control.

647
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,140
Thanks for that.

648
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,140
You're doing an excellent job in clarifying, at least to me, how should I just visualize

649
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,860
even systems that you're acting on?

650
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:59,300
So I guess in my imagination, at least, I'm visualizing a microscope endowed with some

651
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,940
tool that allows you to shine light onto.

652
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,180
We have our cells in little containers that shine light through them.

653
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:13,620
And in that particular case, we had to develop new technology to allow us to shine light

654
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,380
on individual cells.

655
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,220
And that's kind of, again, using MEMS technology, microelectromechanical systems.

656
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,140
So technology that was developed for projectors.

657
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,140
And these are called digital micromirror devices.

658
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,820
So these are, you can think about it as an array of millions of micromirrors, each of

659
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,540
which can be controlled with an electrostatic field.

660
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,700
And in this way, you can point the mirrors any direction you want.

661
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:48,900
So you can shine light on a single cell or on even a subcellular compartment with the

662
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,340
intensity that you want.

663
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:55,540
So this allows us to very, very precisely target individual cells.

664
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,260
And we can have a controller for that one cell.

665
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,900
You cannot see it with your naked eye, but there's a controller in the computer running

666
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,740
in feedback for that particular cell.

667
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,900
And you can do this simultaneously and in parallel for thousands of cells.

668
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:16,420
And so that's, again, brings in technology to allow us to do the feedback control of

669
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,620
individual cells.

670
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,820
I was about to mention that.

671
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:24,340
So there is an immense challenge also from a technological perspective in order to implement

672
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:30,820
actuators, as you say, and sensors, which seems to be something easy as we, at least

673
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,260
you make it sound like it's something easy, but it's definitely not.

674
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,220
It's a huge component of your work, I guess.

675
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,420
But I also found very interesting what you mentioned about controllers that are acting

676
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,940
in living cells.

677
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,340
And I was wondering, what do you use as media to create those controllers?

678
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,340
Should I imagine viruses acting into a cell or how does it work?

679
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,260
So how do we introduce our controllers?

680
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,820
Exactly.

681
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,380
Yeah, yeah.

682
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,380
I mean, there are different ways.

683
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,540
So in the lab, what we normally do is we use electroporation.

684
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:14,020
So a process by which you subject the cells to an electric field and their membranes become

685
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,020
more…allows you to introduce genetic material inside the cell.

686
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:23,780
So this is by far the most common way, electroporation.

687
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,620
And that works reasonably well.

688
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,100
So it allows you to introduce new genetic material inside the cell.

689
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:38,900
In a lot of the treatments that people do, if you want to access, let's say, cells in a

690
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,940
living human or in a mouse model, there are different vehicles.

691
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:51,060
So one can think of using viruses, lentiviruses, as a vehicle for delivering genetic material.

692
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:58,100
And viruses have evolved to be very efficient and effective at penetrating host cells and

693
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,860
to deliver their own DNA to infect the cell.

694
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,340
So now people can or biologists can exploit that feature.

695
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,300
And instead of having the native DNA of the virus, they introduce their own, let's say,

696
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,660
therapeutic genetic material into that virus that then goes on to deliver the material.

697
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:22,500
So these are some of the tricks by which you would introduce novel genetic material that

698
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,580
then gets expressed into your favorite circuit, synthetic circuit.

699
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,420
That's incredible.

700
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,300
Again, it sounds like science fiction, but it's incredible that we're actually able to

701
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,100
do such things.

702
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,460
I'd like to take a step back before we move on towards something that I find incredibly

703
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:39,860
exciting.

704
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,340
So the applications of all these ideas.

705
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,340
What can we hope to achieve with these tools?

706
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,700
Spending the last few words maybe on the antithetic integral feedback motif.

707
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,660
First of all, I'd like to understand the reason of calling it antithetic integral feedback.

708
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,260
And then I'd like to understand how it works a little bit from a control theoretic perspective.

709
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,260
Okay.

710
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,300
Without equations.

711
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,780
I understand it's a huge challenge, but we can try.

712
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,100
Yeah.

713
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,420
Okay.

714
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,860
So why it's called antithetic?

715
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,020
Well, that goes back to the way this works.

716
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:19,380
So at the basis of this antithetic controller are two controller molecules.

717
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,460
We call them Z1 and Z2.

718
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,380
One molecule, Z1, gets expressed at a constant rate.

719
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:26,500
Okay.

720
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,420
And it's stable, so it doesn't degrade.

721
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,140
So you're just producing this molecule at a constant rate.

722
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,900
The other molecule, Z2, acts like a sensor.

723
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,860
And so the rate of production depends on the abundance of the molecule you want to regulate.

724
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,740
Okay.

725
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:48,340
So the rate of synthesis of Z2 is proportional to the variable, let's say, x, that you want

726
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,220
to keep constant.

727
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:57,300
And now the reaction, the key reaction underlying this motif is a reaction in which one molecule

728
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:03,140
of Z1 binds to another molecule of Z2, and they mutually annihilate each other.

729
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,020
Strictly speaking, they don't have to annihilate each other.

730
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:10,660
They could still be bound as long as the complex is not functional, things will still work.

731
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,820
But let's just say they annihilate each other.

732
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,620
Okay.

733
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,260
One to one.

734
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:21,540
So this process is, I mean, so the two molecules are in some ways antagonistic to each other.

735
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,860
That's the name, antithetic control.

736
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:30,820
In fact, when I called it that, I didn't have any idea that actually many of the motifs

737
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:37,620
we will find out later on to implement this are things like sigma factor anti-sigma.

738
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,940
They were already called like this, you know, sigma anti-sigma, toxin anti-toxin, you know,

739
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,900
holon anti-holon.

740
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:49,700
These are all pairs of molecules that have exactly the property we want for realizing

741
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,900
this motif.

742
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,060
And so it was appropriate to use that antithetic terminology, it was fortunate that we used

743
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,700
it at the time.

744
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,700
So how does this work?

745
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:07,780
Yeah, that's, so if you think about this operation, Z1 and Z2, and, you know, they have this

746
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,460
property that they bind with each other.

747
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,980
If you have an abundance of Z1 and abundance of Z2, and let's say they bind together one

748
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:25,300
to one, then what's left is the difference, right, between Z1 or Z2, if it's positive

749
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,620
or not.

750
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,580
So this allows you to do this positive negative type of thing.

751
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,460
And the integration happens because of the nature of the operation.

752
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,420
These things are being produced at a dynamic rate.

753
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:44,980
And so when you subtract the dynamics of production of Z1 and Z2, what you're left with is the

754
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,500
difference between them.

755
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,540
The dynamics of the difference is what actually implements the integral of the error.

756
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:58,340
So the difference of two positive quantities can be positive or negative.

757
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,100
So this allows us to also overcome this issue with the sign.

758
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,980
I mean, that's roughly speaking.

759
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:13,140
And I can show you in the right, you know, in 30 seconds if I write the equation.

760
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,940
Now, of course, there will be a link in the description to everything that we talked about.

761
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,740
So of course, the Nature paper from 2019, but also a wonderful, I would call it an overview

762
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:30,100
or almost a manifesto paper about cybergenetics that appeared on the proceedings of the IEEE

763
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,300
in 2022.

764
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,620
I just wanted to clarify for terminology for the audience of control theory.

765
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,100
What does it mean actually to annihilate?

766
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,300
And what does it mean to bind?

767
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,540
I know that these are very naive questions, but it might be worth just mentioning what

768
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,100
those mean.

769
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:49,140
Yeah, I guess I should have explained those things because I myself had struggled with

770
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,820
these concepts when I was first learning.

771
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:57,300
So binding is the process in which two molecules combine and form a complex.

772
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:04,100
So A plus B gives you C. C consists of both A and B, so this is a binding event.

773
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,500
And now the bound species may have different properties, right?

774
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,220
It could be inactive, whereas A and B are on their own active.

775
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,460
When they bind together, they could annihilate.

776
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,700
So they could inactivate each other.

777
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:24,420
Annihilation just simply means that they mutually degrade each other, right?

778
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,500
So that the protein is no longer functional.

779
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:34,980
Maybe it's ideally it gets broken down into amino acids that get recycled.

780
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,220
Very often that's not what actually happens.

781
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,140
You don't really need it to be annihilated.

782
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,900
It's just an idealization.

783
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,060
All they need to do is just deactivate.

784
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,700
They just need to be non-functional in the complex form.

785
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,180
Should I picture it as the concentration exponentially decreases of this substance

786
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,380
or what do you mean by it's no longer functional?

787
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,740
Like, let's say, for example, Z1.

788
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:06,580
Z1, in order to close the feedback loop, has to activate another gene that closes the feedback

789
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,220
loop.

790
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,660
Now, when it's bound to Z2, it can no longer do that.

791
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,060
So it no longer acts as an activator.

792
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,260
It's inert, if you wish, biologically inert.

793
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:24,580
Whereas before the binding event, Z1 is a functional molecule that's a variable that

794
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,780
activates other variables and closes the feedback loop.

795
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,140
Now, once it's in that complex form, it's out of the picture.

796
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,260
You can just completely ignore it in terms of the chemical reactions.

797
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,380
It's no longer functional.

798
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,980
So while we're on this subject, I also want to touch on two other things that I believe

799
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,180
are incredibly exciting.

800
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:50,660
So one of them is that, of course, after 2019, you moved forward and you added derivative

801
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,620
action as well.

802
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,260
I mean, proportional and derivative action.

803
00:54:54,260 --> 00:55:00,180
So at the moment, we do have a real PID controller for biomolecular systems.

804
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:00,680
Am I right?

805
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,420
Not quite.

806
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:09,940
So we have since built PI controllers and demonstrated them in mammalian cells, which

807
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:15,380
is always important because the way we want to use them for medical applications.

808
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:21,460
We've also come up with all the right motifs that one would need to implement the derivative

809
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,220
aspect of part of the controller.

810
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,100
But we haven't to date demonstrated a PID.

811
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,460
We have demonstrated a PI, but we're working on the last bit, the D.

812
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,940
Admittedly, it's less important than the PI does most of the work that you need.

813
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:43,940
So it's just, I think, it would be nice and satisfying to have the derivative component.

814
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,460
This is another question.

815
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,940
How would you implement different derivatives using biological component?

816
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:56,020
I mean, it turns out if you know how to build an integrator and you put an integrator in

817
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:02,820
a feedback loop with a unity feedforward path, then so if you have an identity for

818
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,060
the forward loop and then an integrator in the feedback loop, what you end up with in

819
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,780
the transfer function between the input and the output is actually a differentiator with

820
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,860
a low-pass filter, which is exactly what we need.

821
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,380
We need the low-pass filter as well.

822
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,500
As you know, all differentiators have low-pass filters in practice.

823
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:27,060
And so having implemented an integrator, we have the ingredient that's needed to

824
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,740
implement a differentiator.

825
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,380
It's not the only way, but it's actually one way to do it.

826
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,420
And it's just, I think, a matter of time when this finally works.

827
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,020
I think for applications, as I mentioned, it may not be necessary.

828
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,100
There are reasons why you want to have a differentiator, similar to the reasons why

829
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,180
control engineers in the field use PID and not just PI.

830
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:53,060
You know, you can get faster response and good transients and so on.

831
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,980
It could also reduce variability, so cell-to-cell variability.

832
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,460
But strictly speaking, it's not necessary.

833
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:05,620
In fact, you know, working in the field with a company when I was back in the U.S., I noticed

834
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:11,140
that very often the engineers have PID controllers, but they actually have turned off the D part.

835
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,980
They just use it as a PI.

836
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:17,780
I guess 95% of the real PIDs actually do work like that.

837
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,420
Yeah.

838
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:23,940
I find very, very interesting the fact that, you know, the conceptual analogies that you

839
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,900
do make with transfer functions actually work in practice.

840
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:33,940
So one is guided by those concepts to realize something that is physically very, very different

841
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,620
to the ideas that we have in mind.

842
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,660
I also thought that before, you know, moving towards the applications and the future of

843
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:45,620
this field, it would be interesting to talk about the actual systems that you do work on.

844
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:51,380
You mentioned that mammalian cells are something that is important for demonstrative purposes,

845
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,140
but generally that's not the only type of cell that you do work on, right?

846
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,540
Yeah, that's correct.

847
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:04,260
I mean, normally in this business, there are a few organisms that serve as model organisms

848
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,060
where, you know, the genetics have been worked out.

849
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,020
There's a lot of tools that people have used.

850
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:15,860
And so, you know, people tend to work with those model organisms or model cells because

851
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,220
life is much easier that way.

852
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,140
I mean, biology is already hard enough.

853
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:24,180
Why make it even more complicated by working on some exotic bacterium that, you know, perhaps

854
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,580
the genetics of which haven't been worked out yet.

855
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,180
And so some of these model organisms are things like E. coli, right?

856
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:37,380
So E. coli is probably the best understood living organism, more than us.

857
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:43,060
Yeast, budding yeast, so the baker's yeast is another model organism that kind of has

858
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,100
a nucleus, unlike the bacteria that doesn't have a nucleus.

859
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,740
So it's called the eukaryotic cell because of that.

860
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,620
And of course, us, you know, that's mammalian cells, right?

861
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,860
So the sizes of these cells differs drastically.

862
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:03,620
So with the E. coli being the tiniest, and then the yeast in between, and the mammalian

863
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,860
cells are huge in comparison.

864
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,820
But also the genetic challenges are also different.

865
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,180
So mammalian cells are more complicated to work with.

866
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,300
They take more time.

867
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,020
Reagents are much more expensive.

868
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,220
But of course, they're much more important, right, for us.

869
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:26,660
So if you're thinking about therapeutics, even if you want to do things like antibody

870
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:32,900
production in a bioreactor, you still need to work with Joe cells, and those are mammalian

871
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,400
cells.

872
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:38,260
So the evolution of my lab started from E. coli.

873
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,860
It was the simplest organism.

874
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,580
It was the easiest to do genetic tests.

875
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,340
It was the fastest and the cheapest.

876
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:51,940
And then as we gained more confidence, we felt that if we are to have an impact on biomedical

877
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,700
applications, we had better tackle the mammalian cells.

878
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,940
And so gradually, we added yeast cells and as well as mammalian cells.

879
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:05,540
And now I think most people in my group work on mammalian synthetic biology, with all the

880
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,100
challenges and also the opportunities that come with that.

881
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,740
So and what type of mammalian cells, if I may ask?

882
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,620
So there are different types we work with.

883
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,580
We work on cells called HeLa cells.

884
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,220
These are one type of cells.

885
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,820
Another type we work on are called HeK cells.

886
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,180
And then we also work on stem cells, so mouse embryonic stem cells.

887
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,660
So those are the three cell types that we mostly work with.

888
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:38,740
And I think we will start soon working on Joe cells.

889
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,740
So these are hamster cells, hamsteric cells.

890
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:41,220
Okay.

891
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,140
Yeah.

892
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,140
So maybe now it's a good moment to shift gears and move towards the future.

893
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:53,060
So the applications of this field that you dubbed cybergenetics, what can we actually

894
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:53,380
achieve?

895
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:58,180
I mean, I know that there are things nowadays that are science fiction, almost.

896
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:03,780
We were chatting yesterday, just before recording this episode, that we can nowadays control

897
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:09,700
the firing, individual firing in nerve cells of mice or rats, I forget.

898
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:14,900
So the ability to engineer living cells opens up quite a bit of possibilities.

899
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:17,780
Yes, that's right.

900
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,580
I mean, one can think of it in different ways.

901
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,340
I mean, you can think of agriculture.

902
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:30,020
Of course, genetic engineering methods are well known in agriculture, but also industrial

903
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,980
biotechnology.

904
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,940
So this is one area that I'm also excited about.

905
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:44,020
You would like to be able to make a new protein, maybe more effectively or cheaply, and you

906
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:49,460
would like to do it in such a way that you can control the different enzymes and the

907
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,420
rate of flux at different pathways so that you can get just the optimal amount of protein

908
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:54,980
expression.

909
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:59,700
Now, with cybergenetic techniques using light, we can do this.

910
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:06,180
We have recently demonstrated that we can produce more, have higher yields by simply

911
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,020
closing the feedback loop.

912
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:13,380
And in this case, one can measure, for example, the amount of stress a cell has through this

913
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:19,540
fluorescent protein technology that I told you about, and use that information to decide

914
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:23,620
how much expression a particular gene should have, right?

915
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:28,980
So if you have a gene that produces a product of interest, a protein of interest, overexpressing

916
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:34,260
it is not the best way to get more yield because then the cells get stressed and actually

917
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,380
your yield goes down.

918
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:41,140
And if you underexpress, again, you're not exploiting the maximum capacity of your cell

919
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,740
to produce that protein.

920
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:46,980
There's a sweet spot somewhere in between, and to try to find out where that sweet spot

921
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,260
is and to regulate gene expression, because this sweet spot is moving, you regulate the

922
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,140
gene expression so you're always tracking that sweet spot.

923
01:02:55,140 --> 01:03:00,740
This, I think, is one huge opportunity for cybergenetics in industrial biotechnology.

924
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,940
Very often, the impediment is that you have intermediates that are toxic.

925
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:12,580
And so by knowing what the levels of these intermediates are and adjusting variables

926
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:18,500
like gene expression, you can keep the toxicity level to the bare minimum and in the process

927
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,860
enhance the yield.

928
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,700
So we have in my lab bioreactors or photobioreactors.

929
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:31,140
So these are bioreactors that we have outfitted with LEDs, and we shine the light in feedback

930
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,980
to control the entire population.

931
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,700
We're not doing single cell control, but we are looking at whole population level control.

932
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:43,700
The other application I'm really excited about for synthetic biology is the therapeutic

933
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,540
applications, the medical implications.

934
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,340
And that's more long term and more challenging.

935
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,980
It takes longer time and also has lots of challenges.

936
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:59,780
I mean, you want to have…anytime you put in a modified cell in a human, you need to

937
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,780
get FDA approval.

938
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,740
It's a complex and long process, but it's also extremely promising.

939
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:16,580
So one example of this is…so in, I think, 2017 or 2018, FDA approved the use of CAR-T

940
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:19,060
cells for immunotherapy.

941
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:24,100
And this has been one of the most successful treatments for cancer, right?

942
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,620
So immunotherapy.

943
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:32,900
So these are cells that are genetically modified to attack cancer cells, and essentially it

944
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,900
allows immune response, immune system to target cancer cells.

945
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:42,020
And these cells originate from the patient or from a donor.

946
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:46,340
They're modified in the lab and then put back into the patient's blood so that they

947
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,620
can treat diseases.

948
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:54,660
So the problem is that all of these systems, these cell therapies, generally work in an

949
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,380
open loop.

950
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:00,900
And so the idea is to actually bring in some of these controllers that we've been developing

951
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:06,660
and have these cells work in a closed loop fashion so that they're sensing the disease

952
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:14,020
state and then producing the amount of therapy, therapeutic, just the right amount to regulate

953
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:19,220
the level of, let's say, a particular biomarker, disease biomarker.

954
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:23,220
And so that's the goal that we have in the lab, and that's what we're working towards.

955
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:30,420
We're making better and better PID controllers or PI controllers, and then adding safety

956
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:37,620
features to them so that they can become, let's say, medical grade so that they have

957
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:42,660
anti-wind-up schemes and, you know, the usual things one has to worry about when implementing

958
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,300
integrators in the feedback loop.

959
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:52,740
But really, if you really think about it, most of diseases are essentially due to or

960
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,900
can be attributed to feedback loops that have gone awry, right?

961
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:01,300
So, you know, think about cancer, think about diabetes, and so on.

962
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:06,260
Many of the diseases we encounter are essentially due to the…

963
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,980
Genetic circuits going astray.

964
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,540
Yeah, genetic circuits for various reasons, right?

965
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:18,420
And so, by having the technology to replace these with genetically engineered cells that

966
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:24,180
function as robust control systems, I think we would be able to contribute to disease.

967
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,540
At least that's the guiding principle for us and for what we do.

968
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,100
And, you know, we will see what happens.

969
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,380
This is a long process.

970
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:36,900
It's not something that you can do in the lab today and test it on people the next day.

971
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:42,340
There has to be some different trials, clinical trials, different phases,

972
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,780
and it takes years and years.

973
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,780
But we have to start somewhere.

974
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,260
This is so, so cool.

975
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:54,420
It is science fiction, and I think it's fantastic to watch, you know, from an external perspective.

976
01:06:54,980 --> 01:07:01,140
I kind of envision these things as almost like we are building genetic robots, which is

977
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:02,580
incredible.

978
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:07,140
And I guess it also comes with very important ethical challenges.

979
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,900
Is this something that you thought about?

980
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,540
Yes, I think ethics comes with synthetic biology from day one, right?

981
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:19,460
Anytime you want to modify something genetically, I think one has to think about the consequences.

982
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:25,860
What we do in the lab, you know, these bacteria, they don't survive outside the lab.

983
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,180
So whatever modifications we have will have no consequences.

984
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:36,340
However, these days, the tools are available to do much more powerful genetic changes.

985
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,620
For example, CRISPR-Cas.

986
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:45,620
I think that this is a new technology that led to a Nobel Prize that allows scientists to

987
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:50,180
modify DNA with precision and efficiency.

988
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:57,060
And this led to a lot of discussions about what one should be able to change or not to change.

989
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:02,180
I mean, the danger, of course, is that you can have these CRISPR babies, as they're called.

990
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:09,780
And there has been already some gross violations by one of the scientists who modified human

991
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:15,780
cells to have, you know, two new babies that have modified DNA.

992
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,500
And I think that's very dangerous grounds.

993
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:25,860
There's a fundamental difference between changing, let's say, regular cells and changing,

994
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,700
for example, skin cells or liver cells or cancer cells in one patient,

995
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:36,740
and changing cells that propagate, like, for example, sperm cells or egg cells,

996
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,940
because the genetic modifications are not restricted to the individual,

997
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,380
but they are passed on to their progeny.

998
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,900
And that's much, much more dangerous.

999
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,740
And I think this is something that we are not ready right now to,

1000
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:53,380
or scientists are not ready to go down that path.

1001
01:08:54,340 --> 01:09:00,500
There are certain other diseases where actually you could do a lot of good by modifying the DNA.

1002
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:06,660
Let's say, for example, some patients that have genes that have various mutations that

1003
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,740
lead to diseases.

1004
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:13,540
And so if you can imagine modifying these genes through gene therapy, for example,

1005
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:18,580
and reversing or correcting these mutations to restore normal functions,

1006
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,940
I think that's a very exciting area of gene therapy.

1007
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:27,220
But whatever modifications are made are not passed on to the progeny.

1008
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,380
So I think this is a safer way of doing genetic engineering.

1009
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,220
They're clearly dangerous, right?

1010
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:40,740
So one has to watch out not to make modifications to a cell or, let's say, a bacterium that then

1011
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:44,100
becomes more lethal and escapes the lab and so on.

1012
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:49,300
And so we have to put in place various measures to ensure that this never happens.

1013
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:54,180
And I think ethics goes hand in hand with this business of synthetic biology.

1014
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:59,460
Like many other technologies, I think one has to be careful to put in place the right

1015
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,740
measures to make sure that the chances of accidents like that are basically zero.

1016
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:10,820
So with a lot of these, let's say, cell therapies, one hears about what's so-called kill switches.

1017
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:15,540
So if you put in the wrong therapy or something happens to the patient that has

1018
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:21,780
these genetically engineered cells, there would be the opportunity to kill the cell.

1019
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:27,300
So this would be additional circuitry added on top of the genetic circuit to stop everything.

1020
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:33,460
And so these are some of the measures people look at for trying to mitigate some of these

1021
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,340
risks.

1022
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:40,500
But at the same time, I mean, if you have a patient that is dying and they have

1023
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:46,660
exhausted all other possibilities and there's a new cell therapy available that could give

1024
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:53,060
them the chance to live longer or overcome the disease, I think then one has to take

1025
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:56,100
that into account as well in making these calculations.

1026
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,340
Yeah, I guess it's very much context dependent.

1027
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,300
One thing I wanted to talk about, and then maybe we can move on towards the end of this

1028
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,140
episode, was a paper that I read from you recently.

1029
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,460
It's about the internal model principle.

1030
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:16,180
I know it has little to do with the applications, but it's something that is very close to my

1031
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:19,780
heart, something that I really, really like from classical control theory.

1032
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,300
And I thought it would be nice to touch on that as well before closing.

1033
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,180
Yeah, thanks for bringing this up.

1034
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,740
This is something I've been very excited about recently.

1035
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:34,820
So this is a paper, I guess the PNAS paper that you're referring to, appeared two or

1036
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,540
three months ago.

1037
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:42,100
So what this work addresses, and this is, again, I was talking about having to develop

1038
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,340
a new control theory that's particularly suited for biology, and this is a perfect

1039
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,220
example of that.

1040
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,740
I guess as control people, we are taught early on at the graduate level what the internal

1041
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:58,020
model principle of Francis and Wanam and, you know, the necessity of certain type of

1042
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:03,140
structures, integral feedback, and so on for tracking and rejecting various types of disturbances.

1043
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:08,980
These systems, though, that were addressed by this work are mostly linear systems, and

1044
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,380
they are not positive variables.

1045
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:15,860
They are not constrained by chemical reaction constraints.

1046
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,020
And so in biology, the game is a little bit different.

1047
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:24,500
Now, so for this particular work, we started by defining something called robust perfect

1048
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,220
adaptation.

1049
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,860
This was available for the literature.

1050
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,660
We were not the first to introduce it, but it's a useful notion.

1051
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:37,620
Essentially, it means tracking and disturbance rejection at the steady state that is robust,

1052
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,020
right?

1053
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,380
So robust to what?

1054
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:43,220
Robust to parameter changes, robust to topological changes in the network.

1055
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:50,580
And we know, for example, in the case of constant in time disturbances and signals, that integral

1056
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:55,060
feedback is sufficient for such a robustness, and it's necessary for linear systems.

1057
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:02,980
So how would one address this question if the underlying system is a bunch of molecules

1058
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,300
interacting with each other through chemical reactions?

1059
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,580
So they're positive variables.

1060
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,860
And what we were looking at is how do you define robustness in this case?

1061
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,980
And we looked at the particularly strong notion of robustness.

1062
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:17,860
We called it maximal robust perfect adaptation.

1063
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:22,820
In other words, the system has to be robust to changes in all the variables, all the parameters,

1064
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:29,620
all the reaction rates, except for the ones that determine the set point, like the dial

1065
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,940
that tunes in what the reference should be, right?

1066
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,140
You can't be robust to that.

1067
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:34,820
Shouldn't be, even.

1068
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,260
So that's the maximal robust perfect adaptation.

1069
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,060
That's what it means.

1070
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:46,340
So what kind of biological networks allow you to do perfect tracking that is robust

1071
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,740
to these kind of perturbations?

1072
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,940
And we managed to obtain an answer.

1073
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:58,740
And the answer is different depending on whether this network is deterministic or it has noise.

1074
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:04,100
So it's a stochastic network, with the stochastic network's controllers being more stringent.

1075
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:08,900
So all of the controllers that work for the stochastic network will work for the deterministic,

1076
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,020
but not the other way around.

1077
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:15,460
There are motifs that will work for the noise-free case, that will not work, will break down

1078
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,620
in the noisy case.

1079
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:22,020
For the noisy case, interestingly, we found that underlying all such motifs,

1080
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,740
there is the antithetic motif at the heart as the main core component.

1081
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,900
But more importantly, so we have an algebraic test, a very simple algebraic test.

1082
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,020
You give me the network.

1083
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:36,180
I can apply, look at the certain matrix, and look at those properties.

1084
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:42,420
And then from there, I can tell you whether this network has this adaptation property or not.

1085
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:46,100
And so that's one of the benefits.

1086
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:52,180
And if it does have this property, if it does adapt, I can construct the integrator,

1087
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:54,180
which is usually not obvious.

1088
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,820
Very often, it's a way or a combination of molecules that interact with each other

1089
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,020
in a certain way to implement this integral feedback.

1090
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,180
And so this theory allows you to actually find the integrator,

1091
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,660
which you wouldn't be able to do otherwise.

1092
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:12,980
So that's why I think this is kind of nice from a control theoretic point of view.

1093
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:19,460
It links in classical notions of internal model principles from Murray and Wanham

1094
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:25,220
with sort of modern day biochemical reaction network theory.

1095
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,140
And we have a nice clean answer.

1096
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,740
There's still a lot of open problems, but at least for this particular formulation

1097
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:35,380
that I just described to you, the answer is clean and it's complete.

1098
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:39,940
Oddly enough, I found that this revival of the, let's say,

1099
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:44,580
an interest on the internal model principle has appeared in many different branches of

1100
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:45,460
control theory.

1101
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,300
I've seen papers coming from the neuroscience aspects.

1102
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,820
Of course, many people in the motor control area are also very interested in this concept.

1103
01:15:54,820 --> 01:16:00,740
And as a groupie, if you want, of this concept myself, I find it very exciting.

1104
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,340
I think now is really the time to close this episode.

1105
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,660
It's going to be probably very long.

1106
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,860
So apologies to the audience, but it was, I hope, very interesting.

1107
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,620
It was definitely very interesting to me.

1108
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:17,060
And as I mentioned also to many other guests of the podcast,

1109
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:20,660
I like to ask the question of advice to future students.

1110
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,900
So people that are interfacing with the idea of continuing in this field

1111
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:29,940
or potentially venturing into the synthetic biology or cyber genetics field,

1112
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,460
what is your best advice?

1113
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,980
Okay, interesting.

1114
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,940
So I'm going to give probably a non-traditional advice,

1115
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,020
but it's one I actually do believe in.

1116
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:47,460
And one that I was inspired by a quote from Richard Hamming.

1117
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,020
I don't know if you know Richard Hamming or not, of course,

1118
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,100
if you had an electrical engineering background.

1119
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,700
A stroke of genius.

1120
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,020
Yeah.

1121
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,940
And he had the Hamming filter.

1122
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:59,700
He had also Hamming windows and Hamming codes and so on.

1123
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,140
And he worked with Bell Labs.

1124
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:05,060
So Richard Hamming was interested in the creative process

1125
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,260
and how people do research.

1126
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,300
And he actually wrote several articles on this.

1127
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,740
And one thing that specifically struck me is the following quote.

1128
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,580
Let's see if I can remember it.

1129
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,940
And he says something like this.

1130
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:16,260
He says,

1131
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,660
Most scientists spend almost all of their time

1132
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:26,020
working on problems that even they don't consider great,

1133
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:30,020
nor do they consider these problems will lead to great work.

1134
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:31,700
And so he says,

1135
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,660
Then if you are working on unimportant problems,

1136
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,140
you're not going to end up with important work,

1137
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,860
except by the dumbest of luck.

1138
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,940
So this may seem trivial,

1139
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,540
maybe obvious that, of course,

1140
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,380
if you don't work on important problems,

1141
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,340
you don't end up doing important work.

1142
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,540
But I think considering that many people

1143
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,900
know that the problems they're working on are not important,

1144
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,740
and I think it behooves us to give this more thought.

1145
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,580
So if you are starting,

1146
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,100
if you're a new student that are starting to look for a PhD problem,

1147
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,500
then I think it is useful to always ask yourself,

1148
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,100
even though the problem that you're working on seems interesting,

1149
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,860
and the solution approach is interesting,

1150
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,060
and the tools are interesting,

1151
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,980
how relevant would be the solution?

1152
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,980
If you are to solve what you're trying to solve,

1153
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,740
what would be the impact?

1154
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,820
And if it's minimal,

1155
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:30,340
maybe it's a chance to look for another problem that has a more impact.

1156
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,860
And I think really few people think about this.

1157
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:39,780
Usually the way you end up working on certain problems by chance,

1158
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,700
you talk to somebody, or you hear a talk,

1159
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,020
and you say,

1160
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,140
Ah, that sounds interesting.

1161
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,900
I can use this tool or that tool.

1162
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,620
And you get involved with the problem details,

1163
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,380
and it's fun and exciting.

1164
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,660
But at the end of the day,

1165
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:52,100
is it relevant?

1166
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,060
Is it important?

1167
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:57,780
And I think it's a good idea to ask oneself every now and then,

1168
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,340
Am I working on important problems?

1169
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:04,020
There are always exciting tools and exciting approaches,

1170
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,780
no matter what field you work on.

1171
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:11,460
So I think simply by addressing this question head on early,

1172
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,500
I think one could, let's say,

1173
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,940
have a better chance of having an impact once a solution is obtained.

1174
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,500
So that's my advice is, you know,

1175
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,060
ask yourself, is this an important problem?

1176
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,580
Because if it's not an important problem,

1177
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,380
it's not likely to lead to important results.

1178
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,180
I'm not saying it will for sure not lead to important,

1179
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,540
which sometimes, you know, there is,

1180
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,580
you might run into something that ends up being important.

1181
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,820
You didn't intend to solve that problem,

1182
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:39,620
but you know, it's just serendipity kicks in, right?

1183
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,900
Still, I think to the extent that you have an impact on what problems you choose,

1184
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:50,820
I think it's a good idea to think about the potential impact of a solution.

1185
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,820
Well, Mustafa, with this, I think we can close this episode.
