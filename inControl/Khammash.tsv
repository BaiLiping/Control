0	10480	Hello and welcome to In Control, the first podcast on control theory.
10480	23000	Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence and much more.
23000	26600	I'm your host Alberto Padoan, live from a recording studio in Zurich.
26600	30840	Big thanks to our sponsor, the National Centre of Competence in Research of Dependable Ubiquitous
30840	35120	Automation and the International Federation of Automatic Control.
35120	39560	Our guest today is Mustafa Kammasch, Professor of Control Theory and Systems Biology in the
39560	44320	Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich.
44320	45840	Welcome to the show, Mustafa.
45840	47120	Glad to be here.
47120	50200	Thanks for having me at your podcast, Alberto.
50200	52520	Mustafa, let's jump right into it.
52520	55800	What is cyber genetics?
55800	63320	Cyber genetics is actually a portmanteau of two words, cybernetics and genetics.
63320	69160	And it's a term I came up with a few years ago because I got tired of saying all the
69160	74680	time research at the interface of systems and control theory and genetic engineering.
74680	80560	So it just seems much more fun and much more compact to just say cyber genetics.
80560	86960	So essentially it is just that, it's a fusion of cybernetics, which is the term coined by
86960	95320	Norbert Wiener in 1948, which aims to study control and communication in the human and
95320	99880	in the machine under the same umbrella.
99880	104680	And it has a more modern feature, which is the genetics part.
104680	110480	As you see, at the time of Norbert Wiener, 1948, the structure of DNA hasn't even been
110480	112280	discovered yet.
112280	119600	And so much of the work that went on in cybernetics had more to do with things like neuroscience,
119600	125860	maybe diseases that had to do with neuromuscular sources.
125860	128240	But nowadays we have much more powerful tools.
128240	132340	We have much more powerful genetic tools and we could do so much more.
132340	136960	And so you can imagine now we can bring this cybernetics to a new level.
136960	139820	So that's what I mean when I say cyber genetics.
139820	143300	Yeah, that's a fantastic definition.
143300	147060	I might ask, what is a gene actually?
147060	148220	What do we mean by that?
148220	150780	And what do we mean by genetics?
150780	152860	What are the goals there?
152860	158540	Yeah, I think a gene is essentially the basic hereditary units.
159260	165480	You know, very simply, you can think of a gene as corresponding to a single protein.
165480	166660	It's not exactly like that.
166660	170820	It's not always like that, but I think this is good enough.
170820	178340	And so each gene is a stretch of DNA encoded using nucleotides on DNA.
178340	183240	And when that stretch is expressed, the outcome is a single protein.
183240	188880	This protein goes on to interact with other proteins or maybe with other genes to implement
188880	190880	various different functions.
190880	196120	I guess there it would be useful to have a small primer on how biology works and how
196120	199680	DNA is used in biology or in biological systems.
199680	203900	Yeah, so of course DNA is central to life.
203900	209840	In its sequences are encoded, you know, all the biological functions that the organism
209840	211840	requires.
212320	216480	It's extremely dense with information.
216480	222620	And so you can think about DNA as encoding all the information needed for the biological
222620	225140	processes required for life.
225140	229700	But it's not only a storage device, because DNA itself is a molecule and it interacts
229700	237960	with other proteins through which this interaction regulates the amount of gene expression.
237960	243000	So gene expression is a term that comes up repeatedly, and you mentioned something about
243000	244000	it.
244000	246040	So it consists of two different processes.
246040	250700	The first one is transcription, and the second one is translation.
250700	257400	So transcription is the process by which the DNA is read inside the cell.
257400	263060	And the outcome of this transcription process is messenger RNA.
263060	271540	So you have a messenger RNA that then goes on to be translated by cellular machines called
271540	278900	ribosomes, and the outcome of that process, of that translation process, is these proteins.
278900	286500	Usually you have a sequence of amino acids that then folds into a secondary structure
286500	292340	or a tertiary structure, and once it's fully folded, then it's called a protein, and that's
292340	293340	when it's functional.
293340	297740	And by functional, I mean, you know, it can interact with other proteins, with other RNAs,
297740	303820	with other genes, to do all the wonderful things that the cell has to do to exist.
303820	309260	I guess that maybe at this point already, someone in the audience will think, am I listening
309260	311620	to the right podcast?
311620	314940	But you mentioned so many words that come from engineering.
314940	321460	So you mentioned regulation, you mentioned machines, you literally called ribosomes machines,
321620	325940	you mentioned interaction, which is so key in our field.
325940	331300	So what is the role of control theory here, and what does it have to do with biology?
332740	336420	Actually, control is very native to biology.
336420	343940	In fact, biological systems discovered control billions of years before we did,
344580	349380	and they have been employing it in different flavors, different levels of organization,
350100	352100	much longer than we have.
353060	359700	And so it's not really an exaggeration to say that much of the complexity of biological
359700	362980	systems have to do with the requirements of regulation.
363540	368180	And that's because regulation, or what biologists call regulation, what we also call control,
369300	376100	exists at every level of organization in biology, from the molecular level, to the cellular level,
376100	379860	to the tissue level, to the organism level, even to the ecological level.
380500	386740	And so if you look at the typical biological systems, you will very quickly find tons and
386740	392420	tons of feedback loops, feedforward loops that are helping the cells achieve their various
392420	395060	functions in a very robust fashion.
395060	402100	So really, it's quite natural to be doing control in biology, because as I said, much
402100	405380	of the complexity of biology is about regulation.
406260	407620	Or comes from this regulation.
408900	409220	Yeah.
409220	414260	And I was actually looking at your biography, you know, in doing my homework for this podcast,
414260	419780	and you're natively a control theorist, but you then moved, ventured, if you want, in
419780	420260	this field.
420820	425220	And so I was wondering what has drawn your attention from being a very theoretical person
425220	432100	who was working into deep questions in robust control towards this fascinating field?
433220	434580	Yeah, that's a very good question.
434580	439700	Actually, thinking back at those times, this was in the late 90s.
441060	446980	So I was working on robust control for my PhD thesis, and the early and mid into the
446980	449700	late 90s, I was still working on robust control.
449700	454020	But by that time, really, the main problems in robust control have been solved.
454020	458740	So the H-infinity problems, state space solutions, Turicati equation problem has been solved.
459460	464260	And there wasn't much left in terms of, you know, big problems.
465060	470100	And at the same time, around the same time, my wife had our second child.
470100	475620	And after childbirth, she had the problems with her thyroid gland.
475620	480340	So she was going through a period of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.
480340	486180	So the thyroid hormones were essentially oscillating like crazy.
486820	488900	And I had no idea what was going on.
489780	493780	So I went to the library and I picked up a textbook on endocrinology.
493780	496420	Endocrinology is a science of hormones and their actions.
497220	502740	And really, this was a very transformative moment because I was shocked by what I was
502740	503620	reading.
503620	510580	Everything in that book seemed like it's a control theory without equations, right?
510580	516340	So there's one exquisite feedback loop after the other, doing all kinds of different things,
516980	518340	but of course, no equations.
518340	520020	So I was really fascinated by this.
520020	526100	And that led me to go to the National Animal Disease Center at Iowa State University, where
526100	527620	I was at the time in the US.
528260	532420	And I talked to one of the physiologists and I said, you know, I'm a control theorist.
532420	536180	Please, can you give me a problem where you think control theory could be useful?
536180	540180	And it was very naive, but actually, it turned out he gave me a fantastic problem.
541060	549140	He gave me a problem that he was working on that had to do with how mammals, in his particular
549140	552660	case, dairy cows, regulate their blood calcium.
554100	562100	So us humans and other mammals, we have a very tight regulation of calcium in the blood
562100	562580	plasma.
562580	567140	This is important because calcium ions are needed for muscle function, nerve function,
567140	569300	blood clotting, signal communications, and so on.
569300	572580	So it's a very important biochemical role.
572580	580020	And because of that, we have evolved a very elaborate control system to maintain the
580020	583700	concentration at about 9 milligrams per deciliter.
583700	588500	So it's really a fascinating problem, and it could have been a better problem to start
588500	588740	with.
589460	595460	In that case, they were looking at a specific disease that dairy cows had that humans don't
595460	596100	usually have.
596100	597220	It's called milk fever.
598180	603220	And it turned out to be some kind of a dynamic instability in the closed-loop system that
603220	608580	was induced by the way humans breed cows to make more and more and more milk.
609460	616660	And so myself and another young master's students that I had, we had a lot of fun
616660	617860	working out the details.
618660	624340	And when all the dust settled, we had discovered that mammals regulate their blood calcium
625300	627700	by using proportional integral feedback.
627700	628820	It's as simple as that.
629380	632500	So that was kind of a nice discovery.
633060	637300	All the ingredients and the elements were there in terms of the main players, the hormones
637300	638260	and their interactions.
639140	645460	It just waited for somebody with a control perspective to explain what these interactions
645460	646580	were actually doing.
646580	651780	Well, you probably didn't have any mathematical model for studying this phenomenon, or was
651780	653140	there actually any?
653140	654900	Did you have to develop everything from scratch?
655700	661460	We didn't have any mathematical model, but we developed a very, very simple model, actually.
662180	667220	Just looking at the blood volume as a constant volume and looking at various sources for
667220	672580	calciums and various sinks, and then making simple arguments like, you know, disturbance
672580	674660	looks like an outflux of calcium.
674660	679780	And then we know the system regulates with zero steady-state tracking error, so the
679780	682100	controller must have such and such properties.
682740	686900	And so the model we used actually was very simple, maybe a second-order model.
686900	692500	Only when we were looking at the specific disease did we have to go to more complicated
692500	693300	nonlinearities.
693300	698100	And even then, there were saturation-type nonlinearities, which were very naturally
698900	703780	justified based on the nature of the disease that we were working with.
703780	708420	So basically, third-order linear systems with saturation nonlinearities.
708420	710100	That was sufficient to explain the whole story.
710100	714500	Of course, one can develop more complicated models with different compartments and so
714500	719060	on, but I think for the purposes that we needed it, this was sufficient.
719060	720180	And the essence was there.
720900	726820	And so that was your, let's say, initial start in this world of systems and synthetic
726820	727220	biology.
727220	731700	Actually, may I ask, what is the difference between the two fields, between synthetic
731700	733140	biology and systems biology?
733860	734900	That's a very good question.
734900	737220	I get asked this question a lot.
737940	745460	I think, you know, one analogy would be it's similar to the difference between system theory
745460	746420	and control theory.
747780	755620	So systems biology aims to analyze existing biological networks, and it's some kind of
756260	758100	reverse engineering, if you will.
758100	762740	So you have a network that's functional, you have a cell that's doing a certain thing,
762740	765300	you're trying to understand why it does what it does.
765300	768260	And when it fails, why it fails.
768260	771620	And so you kind of ask questions about a network that already exists.
772340	776660	Now, synthetic biology does things a little bit differently.
776660	778660	So it's more like a forward engineering.
779860	782340	How can we modify this network?
782340	790100	How can we add additional components so that it either achieves new function or it fixes
790100	792660	the function that somehow was broken, right?
792660	798580	So if there's a disease and then you add a new element into your cells to kind of cure
798580	802340	that disease, this would be more on the forward engineering part.
802340	804340	So I think that's really the main difference.
805140	809540	It's like adding the synthesis aspect to a systems biology.
810180	815060	In our language, the former would be analysis, dealing with analysis, and the second would
815060	816100	be dealing with design.
817220	819620	So they go hand in hand, they're complementary.
819620	822260	That's a very good way of saying it.
822340	825300	Also, synthetic biology can be used for analysis.
825300	831380	So for example, let's say you have a hypothesis about a biological system, you think it works
831380	835140	in a certain way, and then you go build it in the lab.
835140	838740	And if it doesn't function the way it's supposed to function, then you have to adjust
838740	839620	your understanding.
840500	848020	And so one can also think of synthetic biology as sort of a field that allows you to tinker
848020	854020	and get a deeper understanding of the underlying science, not only just to build new things.
854020	858660	And this is reminiscent of another Feynman quote, building his understanding that appeared
858660	860020	on this podcast before.
860020	860500	Yeah.
860500	862500	What I cannot build, I do not understand.
862500	863700	Exactly, exactly.
863700	864260	Exactly, yeah.
864260	870420	That's an often quoted quote by Richard Feynman, a synthetic biologist.
870420	871060	Yeah.
871060	873700	I think it captures the essence quite well.
874180	879860	Actually, yeah, I was looking at the history of synthetic biology, and it seems to be extremely
879860	885620	recent, at least, you know, the year 2000 seems to be the turning point in this field.
885620	890980	Of course, there are predecessors, but in 2000, there were, I believe, three really
890980	897860	milestone papers on nature where people actually implemented biological circuits that essentially
897860	899220	implemented a switch.
899220	904820	Another one would implement an oscillator, and another circuit would implement a feedback
904820	905860	mechanism, essentially.
905860	907060	So all three in the same year.
907060	908180	It's incredible.
908180	908820	That's right.
908820	910020	Even in the same journal.
912260	912900	Exactly right.
912900	917540	So there were three milestone papers that essentially demonstrated what you said.
917540	920420	One can think of these circuits in the following way.
921060	925220	One of them used one gene, and the second one used two genes, and the third one used
925220	927300	three genes, and they all had negative feedback.
927300	930900	So when you have negative feedback with one gene, you have an auto-regulatory circuit,
930900	933700	so that's the usual feedback systems that we like.
934340	939300	When you have two genes, each having negative feedback on each other, you have positive
939300	943780	feedback, and that's what implements, by stability in this case, a toggle switch.
944580	950180	And the third had, you know, three genes, each repressing the other in a sort of a
950180	951860	ring-type fashion.
951860	953460	So then you get a ring oscillator.
954180	957060	And yeah, that's a work of Michael Elowitz.
957380	962260	Those are the three classic papers that kicked the field into motion.
962260	968900	And in fact, the tools of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, the most important tool,
968900	974900	they were already available in the 70s and 80s, and many biologists actually have done
974900	976020	synthetic constructs.
976020	982820	But I think in the year 2000, people were thinking of this field more like VLSI circuit
982820	983460	design, right?
983460	990660	So you can build circuits and devices that then you can put together into functional
990660	991300	units.
991300	994180	And this is a distinctly engineering approach.
994180	998740	It's no longer just tinkering with one gene or another to see what happens, but it's
998740	1001780	actually with a purpose to build more complex systems.
1002420	1008260	And here we are, what, 23 years later, and, you know, we're still struggling with a lot
1008260	1009620	of these designs.
1009620	1011780	We can build more complicated circuits now.
1012500	1016580	Instead of one or two genes, we can build circuits with tens of genes.
1017140	1018900	But there's still lots of challenges.
1018900	1021380	So I think the field is still in its infancy.
1022020	1025860	A huge promise, of course, but lots of challenges.
1025860	1031300	So I think for researchers who want to work in this field, I think this is a very good
1031300	1032340	time to be doing it.
1033620	1036260	There's a lot to unpack in what you just mentioned.
1037300	1038420	I don't know where to start.
1038820	1044180	One of the things that made me think when you were elaborating on your thoughts was
1044180	1050740	that you touched on so many elementary components that are very familiar to the area of
1050740	1051300	computing.
1051300	1053700	So switches, oscillators.
1053700	1058900	So in hearing about these concepts, what I think about is a computer.
1058900	1062980	So it seems like it's possible to assemble some sort of biological computer out of those
1062980	1063540	components.
1064260	1069140	The second thing that I'm extremely excited about is what we can actually do with these
1069140	1069540	circuits.
1069540	1074500	So the ones that you just mentioned and what is actually the time horizon in which we can
1074500	1077460	hope to see something, let's say, in our lifetime.
1077460	1080500	Is it going to be in two centuries, a millennia?
1080500	1081140	Who knows?
1081140	1086340	And the third thing that I would like to ask you is what are the main developments in the
1086340	1088980	middle, let's say from 2000 to today?
1088980	1091300	So what happened in between?
1093620	1099540	Okay, so starting from the last part of your question, so what happened in between?
1100260	1105860	I think that what happened is people started to build more complex circuits.
1106980	1110340	And in the process, they ran into challenges.
1111300	1116980	So there are various challenges when you're working with biological substrates that one
1116980	1119380	does not find when working with electric circuits.
1120180	1124500	Interestingly, a lot of people working in this field, synthetic and systems, synthetic
1124500	1128100	biology in particular, have a background in physics or engineering and so on.
1129140	1134580	So the electric circuit analogy has been a running theme throughout.
1135540	1140580	And I think while this analogy had served the field well early on, I don't personally
1140580	1147780	think it's any longer a useful analogy to continue to pursue for reasons we can discuss
1147780	1148260	if you want.
1149460	1152820	But the idea there was, you know, you want to modularize everything.
1152820	1158580	So you want to build functional units that then you can combine together with other units
1158580	1163620	in series or in parallel and be able to scale up that way.
1164580	1168500	But biology didn't play well with this vision.
1168500	1169380	There are many issues.
1169380	1174420	For example, when you're doing electric circuits, communication or information is
1174420	1180980	transmitted through conduits, wires that are very, very precise, and only the parts
1180980	1184740	that talk to each other generally talk to each other, right?
1184740	1190580	I mean, of course, you could have electromagnetic interference and so on, but most circuits
1190580	1191620	don't have these issues.
1192660	1193860	In biology, it's not like this.
1193860	1196820	You know, all the molecules see all the other molecules.
1197460	1200980	So the way you would transmit information is through specificity.
1200980	1203860	You know, molecule A binds to molecule B.
1203860	1209540	Maybe it binds molecule C a little bit, but really it's molecule B that it needs to
1209540	1210180	interact with.
1210740	1213700	So you end up with a lot of crosstalk like this.
1213700	1214740	So that's one problem.
1215380	1218580	Another problem is noise or stochasticity.
1219140	1224340	So when you're working with electric circuits, you have your Ohm's law, you have your
1224340	1229540	ordinary differential equations, or, you know, everything is more or less deterministic.
1229540	1234020	Of course, one can still talk about shot noise and so on at various frequencies.
1234020	1235780	But in biology, it's not like this at all.
1235780	1239380	So molecules very often come in very low copy numbers.
1239380	1245860	So you have one gene, for example, a handful of mRNAs, and these interactions between these
1245860	1250420	low copy numbers species, they're random in nature.
1251460	1257300	Molecule A interacts with molecule B only if they happen to bind, collide with each
1257300	1257800	other.
1258260	1263620	But maybe in the process or before that happens, molecule A interacts with molecule C first,
1264340	1266580	and then some other reaction takes place.
1266580	1271700	So really, the timing and order of chemical reactions when you have very low copy numbers
1272260	1272900	is random.
1274260	1278340	So this should be compared with what you've learned in chemistry in high school, where
1278340	1283780	things are present in very large copy numbers, Avogadro's numbers in a test tube, where
1283780	1285620	none of this is true.
1285620	1292180	So you can actually approximate or you can safely describe the dynamics using ordinary
1292180	1293140	differential equations.
1293140	1297300	They're nonlinear, but, you know, that come from mass action kinetics or other type of
1297300	1297780	kinetics.
1297780	1305780	But in the end of the day, you get deterministic equations that represent continuous variables
1306500	1311300	that describe the different concentrations of the different reactions, but not so inside
1311300	1316980	the living cell where the copy numbers is low and the randomness is ever present.
1317540	1325940	So a more suitable tool in this case is to look at, instead of continuous variables that
1325940	1332260	evolve deterministically, you look at stochastic or random variables to represent the number
1332260	1339540	of molecules for each of the different proteins or RNAs and the stochastic nature in which
1339540	1341700	these random variables evolve.
1341700	1347780	So really, the typical model that we work with in this case is a continuous time discrete
1347780	1353780	state Markov process, and that's a much better representation of what's going on inside
1353780	1356900	the living cell, especially when you have very low copy numbers.
1356900	1360100	So noise is another big problem that one has to deal with.
1360100	1364820	Of course, nonlinearity as well, because everything is nonlinear when you have chemical reactions.
1365620	1372660	And so a wealth of mathematical as well as computational problems to deal with.
1373540	1373780	Yeah.
1373780	1377940	So what you just said, essentially you replied to a question that I wanted to ask you, which
1377940	1382180	would be what are the challenges in controlling biomolecular systems?
1382180	1387620	And to me, it seems like the scale in a way determines also the way you describe the processes
1387620	1388820	that you're interested.
1388820	1394340	As you said, there seems to be a fundamental difference between electrical circuits and
1394420	1396900	biomolecular, if you want, systems.
1397460	1401220	So, and I wonder what is the role of control engineering there?
1401220	1403860	So what can we hope to achieve?
1403860	1405860	What is the current progress there?
1406740	1408740	And where are we going towards?
1410260	1416180	I mean, I think I don't want to give the impression that one must only use these stochastic models,
1416180	1417220	otherwise nothing works.
1417220	1421060	Because depending on the problem that you're looking at and the scale that you're looking
1421060	1426820	at, very often deterministic ordinary differential equations can still serve as good models for
1426820	1427940	biological phenomena.
1428820	1433140	Just one has to be careful that when you're looking inside the cell, especially smaller
1433140	1438820	cells like bacteria, this assumption may be violated and you may end up with behaviors
1438820	1439780	that are very different.
1439780	1444100	Very often, actually, the most suitable approach is a hybrid one, where you have some variables
1444100	1451300	that are stochastic and discrete, others are continuous and evolved deterministically,
1451300	1452900	and they interact with each other.
1452900	1457060	So, you know, this is probably the most useful model.
1457060	1459380	So what control problems exist?
1460500	1466740	Even if one sticks to the deterministic framework, and let's talk about this first, the issues
1466740	1472420	that I mentioned before, crosstalk is one of them, you would like to do regulation,
1472420	1476820	you'd like to regulate certain variables, and these variables, for example, must track
1476820	1484260	certain set points or reject certain disturbances, so you end up with a control problem.
1484260	1488820	You know, how do you design a feedback or feedforward mechanism that will implement
1489700	1492420	this or that would meet these control specifications?
1492420	1494740	So what is so challenging about biology?
1495300	1500660	Well, for one thing, again, we're sticking even to deterministic descriptions, all the
1500660	1502820	variables are positive variables.
1502820	1506980	So whatever you want to do, it has to be done with positive quantities, right?
1506980	1508100	So positive systems.
1508740	1512260	I mean, that's one of the main challenges.
1512260	1520100	The functions that you build, the controllers that you have to synthesize, you cannot just
1520100	1523700	write a transfer function and just say, please build me this transfer function, you know,
1523700	1525460	or this nonlinear function.
1526340	1530020	You are constrained by chemical reactions.
1530020	1535380	So everything that you want to implement, your controller, for example, has to be implementable
1536100	1538420	using biochemical reactions, right?
1538420	1540820	So that also adds a second constraint.
1541380	1546500	And it's the interplay of these two constraints, the positivity of the variables plus the
1547060	1551620	constraints that are imposed by the type of interactions you can have inside a living
1551620	1556260	cell, I think give biology the distinctive flavor that it has.
1556980	1559940	And it opens up a wealth of problems in control theory.
1559940	1563620	What kind of controllers can you build using these chemical reactions?
1563620	1569380	How would you achieve, let's say, perfect tracking, robust steady state tracking with
1569380	1572660	these type of controllers and these type of networks?
1573380	1578180	They have to be positive, they have to be implementable, realizable as a chemical reaction.
1578180	1583060	Can you realize any transfer function, or can you approximate it using biochemical reactions?
1583060	1588260	So there's really a wealth of problems that control theory can contribute to.
1589460	1593220	And I'm not saying that existing control theory can address these things, and that's really
1593220	1598500	the beauty of this, is that it's not just, you know, here, I'm just going to move the
1598500	1603220	methods that people have already developed in our field and just apply them to control
1603220	1604580	theory, to biology.
1604580	1605860	That would be the wrong approach.
1606740	1612340	I think one has to be open-minded, and you look at the problems that emerge in biology,
1612340	1621940	and more often than not, you have to develop a new control theory that is suited for biology.
1621940	1624980	And I think that's even more fun that way.
1625540	1627140	So that's what we do in my lab.
1627140	1634020	We try to develop a control theory, a new foundation for control theory at the molecular
1634020	1640340	scale, and then we also try to build these chemical reaction mechanisms using genetic
1640340	1641300	engineering tools.
1642020	1649220	And so I think for me, at least, the challenging part is also the most fun and interesting
1649220	1652420	part, is where the theory and the experiments meet.
1653140	1658980	The theoretical questions are motivated by the experimental considerations, and the experiments
1658980	1663140	we do are always guided or informed by the theory we develop.
1663140	1668900	And there's this interaction, very close interaction, that I think is just, you know,
1669460	1674820	every time theory impacts the experiment, I really get a kick out of this in the lab.
1674820	1682340	And I think that's sitting at the boundary between the experimental world and the control
1682340	1686660	theoretic world is really a very good place to be, at least for me.
1686660	1688500	It sounds incredibly interesting.
1688580	1693300	I just want to comment on what you mentioned before about the constraints, if you want,
1693300	1694580	that biology imposes.
1695140	1700580	So maybe just to clarify the fact that all variables need to be positive, I guess that's
1700580	1705780	because we're always talking about concepts that are quantified quantities of things that
1705780	1709540	are out there, or I guess fluxes or other...
1709540	1710260	Concentrations.
1710260	1711780	Concentrations, exactly.
1711780	1717860	So it's incredible how positive system theory there has a huge role.
1718500	1722740	And the second thing that I wanted to mention is related to the question of realization
1722740	1723780	that you mentioned before.
1724340	1729460	I find it very fascinating that in this context, you're very much constrained, as you mentioned
1729460	1730660	by chemistry.
1730660	1736180	And so the realization theory, if you want, that you can build out of these systems has
1736180	1737620	to comply with those rules.
1738180	1744260	And I guess it imposes huge constraints because everything has to comply with the law of mass
1744260	1747940	action or with those nonlinear equations.
1747940	1753780	And therefore, it's very, very different from, again, the world, the realm of electricity.
1754420	1759380	But I also thought that maybe this is actually a good point, as you mentioned about the work
1759380	1764100	of your lab, to shift gears and to start talking about motifs.
1764100	1770100	And one of the motifs that your lab has developed, which I find incredibly interesting, as a
1770100	1775220	preview to the listeners, we're going to talk about one of the first PI controllers, if
1775220	1780100	not the first, I'm not sure about it, but I think it's the first, in biomolecular systems.
1780100	1785220	And this is something that gets me incredibly excited about the future of this branch of
1786020	1788820	control theory and systems and synthetic biology.
1790180	1793700	Yeah, so biologists like to talk about motifs.
1794580	1799460	That's not a word that exists, I guess, or is commonly used in our field in control
1799460	1799860	theory.
1800420	1802820	So let me just explain what a motif is.
1802820	1810340	So a motif is usually just a pattern that recurs with a frequency that is much higher
1810340	1812660	than one would expect if it were by chance.
1813540	1819300	So you could have a motif in terms of a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA that repeats.
1819300	1823140	What we're more interested in is network motifs.
1823140	1830420	And so these are simple network elements that implement a certain function that you
1830420	1836260	usually see much more frequently than chance, such that this small network forms a basis
1836260	1839300	for much more complex biological behavior.
1839300	1841220	So one example of that is a feedback loop.
1841220	1847460	So that would be a simple network motif, or a feedforward loop, or let's say an oscillator,
1847460	1848900	or a positive feedback loop.
1848900	1850340	So those are the different motifs.
1851220	1858100	When I first joined ETH in 2011, before actually joining, I was just doing purely systems biology,
1858100	1859940	so more analysis, system theory.
1860500	1863860	Now coming to ETH, I had the opportunity to start my own lab.
1864500	1867780	I have to say, before that, I hadn't touched a test tube in my life.
1867780	1873300	So it was a bit of an experience to kind of try to learn all of these techniques and build
1873300	1875300	a wet lab from scratch.
1876100	1878660	But I already had tenure.
1878660	1879460	I had nothing to lose.
1880420	1883220	And so if it didn't work, I would just close it.
1883220	1884180	That's the way you do it.
1884180	1887380	Continue doing theory as usual.
1888100	1891700	And that was one of the best decisions I had made, actually, professionally, is to start
1891700	1892260	a wet lab.
1892260	1897300	Initially, I thought I would just have one bench with one student, maybe doing some experiments
1897300	1899860	to verify the theory.
1900580	1906500	Right now, I have more than 16 different benches, and my group is actually more than half people
1906500	1907380	doing experiments.
1907940	1911300	So it's been a really very rewarding experience.
1912260	1913940	We didn't do it at the expense of theory.
1913940	1920660	We just sort of just added to the theoretical work and gave it much more color and life
1920660	1921620	and meaning.
1922260	1926820	And also to the theoretical questions that we ask are now very different, because they're
1926820	1928980	driven by what we see in the lab.
1928980	1937060	So having the ability to do experiments meant to me that now I can switch from doing system
1937140	1939620	theory to doing control theory.
1939620	1941140	So now we could do synthesis.
1941140	1946580	It didn't really make much sense to do synthesis if you're just doing analyzing existing systems.
1946580	1951860	Now, suppose you would like to design a new feature or you would like to control a living
1951860	1953380	cell in one way or another.
1954340	1962740	We started by using a technique that had been developed earlier called optogenetics, namely
1963380	1967860	developing cells that are actually sensitive to light so that you can actually control
1967860	1970660	them by shining light with different intensities.
1971220	1972980	That was the earlier problem.
1972980	1978740	So we would control, we would still use computer controllers, but the computer controllers
1978740	1985540	would send out signals that are light signals whose intensities actually serve as the actuation.
1986100	1991620	That was fun, and we actually were able to build the first feedback control system.
1992580	1996100	The computer controlled the gene expression at the time.
1996100	1997300	This was 2011.
1998100	2005940	But then another experience that I had in the past, namely integral feedback, came to
2005940	2006500	the front.
2006980	2012900	And the question was, can we build integral feedback controllers inside living cells?
2013700	2018660	You know, having shown that these systems naturally exist, for example, in calcium and
2018660	2024340	many other systems, it was obvious to ask the question, how would you build one?
2024340	2026820	Nobody had built integral feedback controllers.
2027540	2033300	And then, you know, we started trying to build a system that mimics the calcium homeostasis,
2033300	2039220	and we spent a lot of time on it, several years, two or three years, not really very
2039220	2039940	successfully.
2040660	2047220	One time, we thought we had it, and it was exhibiting zero steady state tracking errors,
2047220	2049140	everything that an integrator should do.
2049860	2052820	But to our disappointment, it was actually an artifact.
2052820	2057380	We discovered it was a biological artifact, and what we are seeing was not really the
2057380	2059220	action of an integral feedback controller.
2059220	2065220	It was a combination of negative feedback with disturbance feedforward that was behaving
2066020	2068100	very much like what an integrator would do.
2068900	2075860	And this went on for quite a while, and then I think the breakthrough came from the theory
2075860	2076180	side.
2076820	2083540	We had come up with a new motif that, which now we call, I called it the antithetic motif
2083540	2087780	for a reason that has to do with the way the molecules interact with each other.
2087780	2095220	So this antithetic motif, on paper, should be able to implement or realize integral feedback.
2095860	2101860	And it required two molecules, and you know, you can do negative variables by having two
2101860	2104340	positive variables and look at their difference, essentially.
2104900	2111780	And so this motif is a kind of a sequestration or annihilation motif, to use the term we
2111780	2112900	like to use in biology.
2112900	2118420	But essentially, two molecules bind with each other, and they prevent each other from being
2118420	2119220	active.
2119220	2124900	And one can use that behavior to realize integral feedback control systems.
2125460	2126900	And so the theory was nice.
2126900	2132100	And in fact, it turns out that these type of integral feedback controllers are also
2132100	2132980	noise resistant.
2133620	2137780	So they allow us to solve this problem with stochasticity or noise.
2137780	2142900	In fact, they would exploit noise so that they would function better in the presence
2142900	2143380	of noise.
2143380	2148020	Whereas if the system was noise-free, one would observe oscillations.
2148020	2153140	Now the presence of noise would actually lead to a dampening of this oscillation.
2153140	2156500	Very counterintuitive, but one can prove this mathematically.
2157300	2162420	And so then there was a sudden and abrupt switch in the lab.
2162980	2166260	Okay, drop everything that you're doing with these other systems.
2166260	2169220	Let's now try to implement these antithetic controllers.
2169780	2174900	It still took a good year and a half to two years to build them and verify that they were
2174900	2175460	functional.
2176580	2181780	But in fact, because we had to find the right biological molecules that had the behavior
2181780	2185460	that we were looking for, and it was a very stringent constraint.
2185460	2187620	You know, these molecules have to sequester each other.
2187620	2192340	Once they're bound, they could not function anymore to actuate.
2192340	2197300	And so we found them in the form of what's called sigma factors that exist already in
2197300	2197860	biology.
2198500	2203780	Once we built it, we could verify that we actually have an integral feedback controller
2203780	2204420	on our hands.
2205220	2211220	And I think these were very happy times because it really, from beginning to end, it took
2211220	2215220	a good part of seven years to build that first integral feedback controller.
2215220	2218740	But it was a glorious moment when this finally worked.
2219620	2222980	The paper appeared in Nature in 2019.
2223620	2230900	Now, to 2023, you know, we can build many of these, let's say one every two or three
2230900	2234420	months, with much better properties, better dynamic range.
2234420	2237380	It works in mammalian cells and bacterial cells.
2237380	2242020	So, you know, once we had that first integrator, we started learning about its property and
2242020	2243060	how to optimize it.
2243780	2246100	We have advanced quite a lot since then.
2247220	2253140	That must have felt like a real eureka moment, almost like in Harold Black developing the
2253140	2254660	negative feedback amplifier.
2256100	2262980	At least for me, it was, you know, the culmination of a lot of attempts, failed attempts and
2262980	2263780	a lot of effort.
2264420	2271380	For people in the lab, it was salvation because they no longer had to keep doing these experiments
2271380	2272420	that would take a long time.
2272420	2276660	You see, when you want to do, let's say, a simple time course, you know, and if you're
2276660	2281620	building a circuit, you know, you put a scope, a oscilloscope, and then you look at the voltage
2281620	2284260	up and you see whether steady state is achieved or not.
2284260	2288980	In biology, you know, steady state happens after 10 hours.
2288980	2295460	And so if you want to do a time course, then you have to do samples every so often during
2295460	2300580	this time course, and you have to do all sorts of dilution processes and freezing of these
2300580	2305940	samples and so on just to get one trace, only to find out that it hasn't worked for one
2305940	2306740	reason or another.
2307380	2311140	So it was a very grueling experience for people in the lab.
2311860	2319220	And when the new theory was developed, there was another small gift that came with this
2319220	2327860	theory, and that is that we could show that in the presence of noise, this motif is the
2327860	2330500	only motif that will implement integral feedback.
2331380	2333780	So this is kind of a necessary condition.
2333780	2340180	And the reason why this was good news for the experimentalists is just a realization
2340900	2342980	that this is the right motif.
2342980	2346260	We're not missing another motif that could have done this easier.
2347060	2350900	If it is to work, this is the only way it would work, right?
2350900	2358420	So this was completely reassuring, and it was just a matter of time when they got the
2358420	2362500	circuits to actually work the way we were expecting that they would work.
2363460	2367460	This is incredibly exciting, at least for me as a follower of this story.
2367460	2368260	It's fantastic.
2368900	2373540	I would like to dissect so many of the things that we touched on just in the last few minutes,
2373540	2380820	because we inadvertently touched on the enabling technologies that allowed this Eureka moment
2380820	2381380	to happen.
2382100	2387540	We also touched on the concept of antithetic integral feedback that I would like to dig
2387540	2388900	into a little bit more.
2389540	2391300	Yeah, maybe we can start from the former.
2392500	2398980	Initially, you were speaking about optogenetics, which, pun intended, allowed you to shed new
2398980	2403380	light on these biomolecular phenomena.
2403380	2408420	Maybe we can talk about the enabling technologies that allowed control theory to actually
2408420	2410180	implement these circuits.
2411540	2416820	Yeah, I think when I think of cybergenetics, at least the way I've thought about it, when
2417540	2423780	coming up with ways to do cellular control, one can think of two different flavors, right?
2423780	2425300	So general flavors.
2425300	2430900	One flavor, which is using computers to control living cells, so computers in the loop.
2432180	2436740	There, implementing any control system you like is easy and possible.
2437540	2440820	The challenge there is to interface the computer with the cell.
2441380	2442580	So what do you need for that?
2442580	2444580	Well, you need sensors and you need actuators.
2445220	2449620	In terms of the sensors, we would like to measure what the cell is doing.
2449620	2451460	Let's say how much gene is expressed.
2452180	2453860	I mean, this problem had been worked out.
2454500	2457700	There was a topic of a Nobel Prize 2008 in chemistry.
2458260	2463780	That's the well-known fluorescent protein, the discovery of the green fluorescent protein.
2463780	2465700	The main idea there is very simple.
2465700	2469380	If you have a protein that's being expressed by your gene, what you do is you genetically
2469380	2474740	engineer your gene such that, in addition to that protein, it fuses another protein
2474740	2476100	that fluoresces.
2476100	2481300	So when that original protein is expressed, attached to it is another fluorescent protein.
2481300	2485620	And by measuring the intensity of this fluorescence, you get an idea about the abundance of the
2485620	2486420	expressed protein.
2486420	2488260	And so that's one way to measure.
2488900	2495140	Initially, this was green fluorescent protein, but I think it wasn't long before other colors
2495220	2497940	where other wavelengths were developed.
2497940	2501460	And so one can look at multiple proteins simultaneously.
2501460	2504740	So you can do even multivariable control if you want.
2505460	2508340	But still very challenging with a single output.
2508340	2512100	So the idea, though, we can measure protein abundances.
2512660	2515460	So that solves the problem of sensing.
2516100	2520500	For that, you could either have your cells under a microscope, and then you would image
2520500	2526020	it, and you would, you know, see how much fluorescence that your cells have and quantify
2526020	2526260	that.
2526900	2531940	Or there's another device called a flow cytometer, which allows you to put a cell through a
2531940	2534820	microfluidic channel, shine a laser on it, see how much fluorescence.
2534820	2539220	So you can count the fluorescence of each individual cell, and you could do this for
2539220	2541380	hundreds of thousands of cells a minute.
2541380	2544100	So you can get a nice distribution for your population.
2544660	2549060	You can think of this as a snapshot of the probability density function of the expression.
2549940	2555140	So you can measure, you feed that to the computer, and then to actuate was a problem.
2555140	2559860	So how would we tell the cells how to express, how much to express based on what the computer
2559860	2560340	computes?
2561460	2564420	There, I think we found optogenetics.
2564420	2567380	And that was a technique that has been developed recently.
2568020	2569380	At the time, it was recent.
2569380	2571140	I guess now it's no longer recent.
2571140	2578260	So it allows cells to be light sensitive so that the more light you shine on the cell,
2578260	2580740	the more the gene is expressed.
2580740	2582340	OK, so this is an actuator.
2582980	2588260	We had since developed our own optogenetic systems in bacteria, in yeast, and in mammalian
2588260	2592020	cells that are particularly suited for control applications.
2592020	2597140	But at the time, we just used what was already out there, and it was sufficient.
2597860	2602260	Now you could do sensing, you could do actuation, and you can close the feedback loop with a
2602260	2606980	computer in the loop, and then you can control gene expression, which is something we managed
2606980	2608740	to do in 2011.
2609460	2615860	Since then, we've been using this technology to control cells in a bioreactor so that we
2615860	2621060	can optimize various protein products and various other applications.
2621060	2623780	So this is one flavor where the computer is in the loop.
2623780	2629940	The other flavor, which is actually in many ways is a bit harder, would be the controller
2629940	2631540	is in the cell, right?
2631540	2638260	So you have to genetically engineer the control system so that once you have a genetically
2638260	2643940	modified cell, when the genes, modified genes are expressed, they produce proteins that
2644820	2649540	interact with each other in a way that realizes your control system.
2649540	2652180	So this is what we had to do with the integral controller.
2652180	2658660	We had to modify genetically the cells, in that case it was E. coli at the time, so that
2658660	2664820	they express these sigma factors that aren't normally there in that particular bacterium.
2665780	2667540	It comes from another bacterium.
2667540	2674820	And such that when these proteins are expressed, they implement this antithetic motif and in
2674820	2676580	the process close the feedback loop.
2677540	2680180	So that's the genetically engineered controls.
2680180	2683460	And that's the second flavor of a feedback control.
2684500	2685140	Thanks for that.
2685140	2691140	You're doing an excellent job in clarifying, at least to me, how should I just visualize
2691140	2693860	even systems that you're acting on?
2693860	2699300	So I guess in my imagination, at least, I'm visualizing a microscope endowed with some
2699300	2701940	tool that allows you to shine light onto.
2701940	2706180	We have our cells in little containers that shine light through them.
2706900	2713620	And in that particular case, we had to develop new technology to allow us to shine light
2713620	2715380	on individual cells.
2715380	2721220	And that's kind of, again, using MEMS technology, microelectromechanical systems.
2721780	2725140	So technology that was developed for projectors.
2725140	2729140	And these are called digital micromirror devices.
2729140	2734820	So these are, you can think about it as an array of millions of micromirrors, each of
2734820	2737540	which can be controlled with an electrostatic field.
2737540	2741700	And in this way, you can point the mirrors any direction you want.
2741700	2748900	So you can shine light on a single cell or on even a subcellular compartment with the
2748900	2750340	intensity that you want.
2750340	2755540	So this allows us to very, very precisely target individual cells.
2755540	2758260	And we can have a controller for that one cell.
2758260	2762900	You cannot see it with your naked eye, but there's a controller in the computer running
2762900	2764740	in feedback for that particular cell.
2764740	2768900	And you can do this simultaneously and in parallel for thousands of cells.
2769620	2776420	And so that's, again, brings in technology to allow us to do the feedback control of
2776420	2777620	individual cells.
2777620	2778820	I was about to mention that.
2778820	2784340	So there is an immense challenge also from a technological perspective in order to implement
2784340	2790820	actuators, as you say, and sensors, which seems to be something easy as we, at least
2790820	2794260	you make it sound like it's something easy, but it's definitely not.
2794260	2797220	It's a huge component of your work, I guess.
2798100	2802420	But I also found very interesting what you mentioned about controllers that are acting
2802420	2803940	in living cells.
2803940	2808340	And I was wondering, what do you use as media to create those controllers?
2808340	2812340	Should I imagine viruses acting into a cell or how does it work?
2813540	2816260	So how do we introduce our controllers?
2816260	2816820	Exactly.
2816820	2817380	Yeah, yeah.
2819140	2821380	I mean, there are different ways.
2821380	2825540	So in the lab, what we normally do is we use electroporation.
2825540	2834020	So a process by which you subject the cells to an electric field and their membranes become
2834020	2838020	more…allows you to introduce genetic material inside the cell.
2838020	2843780	So this is by far the most common way, electroporation.
2844340	2847620	And that works reasonably well.
2847620	2852100	So it allows you to introduce new genetic material inside the cell.
2852580	2858900	In a lot of the treatments that people do, if you want to access, let's say, cells in a
2858900	2863940	living human or in a mouse model, there are different vehicles.
2863940	2871060	So one can think of using viruses, lentiviruses, as a vehicle for delivering genetic material.
2871060	2878100	And viruses have evolved to be very efficient and effective at penetrating host cells and
2878100	2881860	to deliver their own DNA to infect the cell.
2881940	2886340	So now people can or biologists can exploit that feature.
2886340	2891300	And instead of having the native DNA of the virus, they introduce their own, let's say,
2891300	2896660	therapeutic genetic material into that virus that then goes on to deliver the material.
2896660	2902500	So these are some of the tricks by which you would introduce novel genetic material that
2902500	2906580	then gets expressed into your favorite circuit, synthetic circuit.
2907140	2908420	That's incredible.
2909140	2913300	Again, it sounds like science fiction, but it's incredible that we're actually able to
2913300	2914100	do such things.
2915060	2919460	I'd like to take a step back before we move on towards something that I find incredibly
2919460	2919860	exciting.
2919860	2922340	So the applications of all these ideas.
2922340	2924340	What can we hope to achieve with these tools?
2924980	2929700	Spending the last few words maybe on the antithetic integral feedback motif.
2929700	2934660	First of all, I'd like to understand the reason of calling it antithetic integral feedback.
2935220	2940260	And then I'd like to understand how it works a little bit from a control theoretic perspective.
2941940	2942260	Okay.
2944340	2945300	Without equations.
2947380	2949780	I understand it's a huge challenge, but we can try.
2949780	2950100	Yeah.
2950100	2950420	Okay.
2950420	2951860	So why it's called antithetic?
2951860	2954020	Well, that goes back to the way this works.
2954020	2959380	So at the basis of this antithetic controller are two controller molecules.
2959380	2961460	We call them Z1 and Z2.
2962260	2965380	One molecule, Z1, gets expressed at a constant rate.
2966180	2966500	Okay.
2966500	2968420	And it's stable, so it doesn't degrade.
2968420	2971140	So you're just producing this molecule at a constant rate.
2971780	2974900	The other molecule, Z2, acts like a sensor.
2974900	2979860	And so the rate of production depends on the abundance of the molecule you want to regulate.
2979860	2980740	Okay.
2980740	2988340	So the rate of synthesis of Z2 is proportional to the variable, let's say, x, that you want
2988340	2989220	to keep constant.
2989940	2997300	And now the reaction, the key reaction underlying this motif is a reaction in which one molecule
2997300	3003140	of Z1 binds to another molecule of Z2, and they mutually annihilate each other.
3003860	3006020	Strictly speaking, they don't have to annihilate each other.
3006020	3010660	They could still be bound as long as the complex is not functional, things will still work.
3010660	3012820	But let's just say they annihilate each other.
3012820	3013620	Okay.
3013620	3014260	One to one.
3015060	3021540	So this process is, I mean, so the two molecules are in some ways antagonistic to each other.
3021540	3023860	That's the name, antithetic control.
3024500	3030820	In fact, when I called it that, I didn't have any idea that actually many of the motifs
3030820	3037620	we will find out later on to implement this are things like sigma factor anti-sigma.
3037620	3041940	They were already called like this, you know, sigma anti-sigma, toxin anti-toxin, you know,
3041940	3042900	holon anti-holon.
3042900	3049700	These are all pairs of molecules that have exactly the property we want for realizing
3049700	3050900	this motif.
3051540	3057060	And so it was appropriate to use that antithetic terminology, it was fortunate that we used
3057060	3057700	it at the time.
3058500	3059700	So how does this work?
3060980	3067780	Yeah, that's, so if you think about this operation, Z1 and Z2, and, you know, they have this
3068980	3071460	property that they bind with each other.
3071460	3076980	If you have an abundance of Z1 and abundance of Z2, and let's say they bind together one
3076980	3085300	to one, then what's left is the difference, right, between Z1 or Z2, if it's positive
3085300	3085620	or not.
3085620	3088580	So this allows you to do this positive negative type of thing.
3089300	3093460	And the integration happens because of the nature of the operation.
3093460	3096420	These things are being produced at a dynamic rate.
3097140	3104980	And so when you subtract the dynamics of production of Z1 and Z2, what you're left with is the
3104980	3106500	difference between them.
3106500	3111540	The dynamics of the difference is what actually implements the integral of the error.
3112580	3118340	So the difference of two positive quantities can be positive or negative.
3118340	3122100	So this allows us to also overcome this issue with the sign.
3122660	3124980	I mean, that's roughly speaking.
3126980	3133140	And I can show you in the right, you know, in 30 seconds if I write the equation.
3133940	3137940	Now, of course, there will be a link in the description to everything that we talked about.
3137940	3144740	So of course, the Nature paper from 2019, but also a wonderful, I would call it an overview
3144740	3150100	or almost a manifesto paper about cybergenetics that appeared on the proceedings of the IEEE
3150100	3151300	in 2022.
3151860	3155620	I just wanted to clarify for terminology for the audience of control theory.
3155620	3158100	What does it mean actually to annihilate?
3158100	3159300	And what does it mean to bind?
3159300	3163540	I know that these are very naive questions, but it might be worth just mentioning what
3163540	3164100	those mean.
3164100	3169140	Yeah, I guess I should have explained those things because I myself had struggled with
3169140	3170820	these concepts when I was first learning.
3171380	3177300	So binding is the process in which two molecules combine and form a complex.
3177780	3184100	So A plus B gives you C. C consists of both A and B, so this is a binding event.
3184100	3188500	And now the bound species may have different properties, right?
3189140	3193220	It could be inactive, whereas A and B are on their own active.
3193220	3195460	When they bind together, they could annihilate.
3195460	3197700	So they could inactivate each other.
3197700	3204420	Annihilation just simply means that they mutually degrade each other, right?
3204420	3208500	So that the protein is no longer functional.
3208500	3214980	Maybe it's ideally it gets broken down into amino acids that get recycled.
3215620	3217220	Very often that's not what actually happens.
3217220	3219140	You don't really need it to be annihilated.
3219140	3220900	It's just an idealization.
3222180	3225060	All they need to do is just deactivate.
3225060	3229700	They just need to be non-functional in the complex form.
3229700	3234180	Should I picture it as the concentration exponentially decreases of this substance
3234180	3237380	or what do you mean by it's no longer functional?
3237380	3240740	Like, let's say, for example, Z1.
3240740	3246580	Z1, in order to close the feedback loop, has to activate another gene that closes the feedback
3246580	3247220	loop.
3247220	3250660	Now, when it's bound to Z2, it can no longer do that.
3250660	3253060	So it no longer acts as an activator.
3253060	3256260	It's inert, if you wish, biologically inert.
3257060	3264580	Whereas before the binding event, Z1 is a functional molecule that's a variable that
3264580	3267780	activates other variables and closes the feedback loop.
3267780	3273140	Now, once it's in that complex form, it's out of the picture.
3273140	3276260	You can just completely ignore it in terms of the chemical reactions.
3276260	3277380	It's no longer functional.
3278100	3282980	So while we're on this subject, I also want to touch on two other things that I believe
3282980	3284180	are incredibly exciting.
3284180	3290660	So one of them is that, of course, after 2019, you moved forward and you added derivative
3290660	3291620	action as well.
3291620	3294260	I mean, proportional and derivative action.
3294260	3300180	So at the moment, we do have a real PID controller for biomolecular systems.
3300180	3300680	Am I right?
3301620	3302420	Not quite.
3303460	3309940	So we have since built PI controllers and demonstrated them in mammalian cells, which
3309940	3315380	is always important because the way we want to use them for medical applications.
3315380	3321460	We've also come up with all the right motifs that one would need to implement the derivative
3321460	3323220	aspect of part of the controller.
3323860	3328100	But we haven't to date demonstrated a PID.
3328100	3331460	We have demonstrated a PI, but we're working on the last bit, the D.
3332260	3337940	Admittedly, it's less important than the PI does most of the work that you need.
3337940	3343940	So it's just, I think, it would be nice and satisfying to have the derivative component.
3344580	3345460	This is another question.
3345460	3349940	How would you implement different derivatives using biological component?
3349940	3356020	I mean, it turns out if you know how to build an integrator and you put an integrator in
3356020	3362820	a feedback loop with a unity feedforward path, then so if you have an identity for
3362820	3367060	the forward loop and then an integrator in the feedback loop, what you end up with in
3367060	3371780	the transfer function between the input and the output is actually a differentiator with
3371780	3373860	a low-pass filter, which is exactly what we need.
3373860	3375380	We need the low-pass filter as well.
3376420	3380500	As you know, all differentiators have low-pass filters in practice.
3381140	3387060	And so having implemented an integrator, we have the ingredient that's needed to
3387060	3388740	implement a differentiator.
3388740	3391380	It's not the only way, but it's actually one way to do it.
3391940	3396420	And it's just, I think, a matter of time when this finally works.
3396420	3400020	I think for applications, as I mentioned, it may not be necessary.
3400020	3404100	There are reasons why you want to have a differentiator, similar to the reasons why
3404740	3408180	control engineers in the field use PID and not just PI.
3408180	3413060	You know, you can get faster response and good transients and so on.
3413060	3416980	It could also reduce variability, so cell-to-cell variability.
3417540	3419460	But strictly speaking, it's not necessary.
3419460	3425620	In fact, you know, working in the field with a company when I was back in the U.S., I noticed
3425620	3431140	that very often the engineers have PID controllers, but they actually have turned off the D part.
3431140	3432980	They just use it as a PI.
3432980	3437780	I guess 95% of the real PIDs actually do work like that.
3437780	3438420	Yeah.
3438420	3443940	I find very, very interesting the fact that, you know, the conceptual analogies that you
3443940	3446900	do make with transfer functions actually work in practice.
3446900	3453940	So one is guided by those concepts to realize something that is physically very, very different
3453940	3455620	to the ideas that we have in mind.
3456180	3460660	I also thought that before, you know, moving towards the applications and the future of
3460660	3465620	this field, it would be interesting to talk about the actual systems that you do work on.
3465620	3471380	You mentioned that mammalian cells are something that is important for demonstrative purposes,
3471380	3475140	but generally that's not the only type of cell that you do work on, right?
3476100	3477540	Yeah, that's correct.
3477540	3484260	I mean, normally in this business, there are a few organisms that serve as model organisms
3484260	3487060	where, you know, the genetics have been worked out.
3487060	3490020	There's a lot of tools that people have used.
3490020	3495860	And so, you know, people tend to work with those model organisms or model cells because
3495860	3497220	life is much easier that way.
3497220	3499140	I mean, biology is already hard enough.
3499140	3504180	Why make it even more complicated by working on some exotic bacterium that, you know, perhaps
3504180	3506580	the genetics of which haven't been worked out yet.
3507380	3512180	And so some of these model organisms are things like E. coli, right?
3512180	3517380	So E. coli is probably the best understood living organism, more than us.
3518020	3523060	Yeast, budding yeast, so the baker's yeast is another model organism that kind of has
3523060	3526100	a nucleus, unlike the bacteria that doesn't have a nucleus.
3526820	3530740	So it's called the eukaryotic cell because of that.
3530740	3533620	And of course, us, you know, that's mammalian cells, right?
3534180	3537860	So the sizes of these cells differs drastically.
3537860	3543620	So with the E. coli being the tiniest, and then the yeast in between, and the mammalian
3543620	3545860	cells are huge in comparison.
3546420	3550820	But also the genetic challenges are also different.
3550820	3554180	So mammalian cells are more complicated to work with.
3554180	3555300	They take more time.
3556260	3558020	Reagents are much more expensive.
3558580	3561220	But of course, they're much more important, right, for us.
3561220	3566660	So if you're thinking about therapeutics, even if you want to do things like antibody
3566660	3572900	production in a bioreactor, you still need to work with Joe cells, and those are mammalian
3572900	3573400	cells.
3573940	3578260	So the evolution of my lab started from E. coli.
3578260	3579860	It was the simplest organism.
3579860	3582580	It was the easiest to do genetic tests.
3582580	3584340	It was the fastest and the cheapest.
3584900	3591940	And then as we gained more confidence, we felt that if we are to have an impact on biomedical
3591940	3595700	applications, we had better tackle the mammalian cells.
3595700	3599940	And so gradually, we added yeast cells and as well as mammalian cells.
3599940	3605540	And now I think most people in my group work on mammalian synthetic biology, with all the
3605540	3608100	challenges and also the opportunities that come with that.
3609220	3612740	So and what type of mammalian cells, if I may ask?
3612740	3615620	So there are different types we work with.
3615620	3618580	We work on cells called HeLa cells.
3619540	3621220	These are one type of cells.
3622020	3624820	Another type we work on are called HeK cells.
3626180	3630180	And then we also work on stem cells, so mouse embryonic stem cells.
3630180	3634660	So those are the three cell types that we mostly work with.
3634660	3638740	And I think we will start soon working on Joe cells.
3638740	3640740	So these are hamster cells, hamsteric cells.
3640980	3641220	Okay.
3642900	3643140	Yeah.
3643140	3647140	So maybe now it's a good moment to shift gears and move towards the future.
3647140	3653060	So the applications of this field that you dubbed cybergenetics, what can we actually
3653060	3653380	achieve?
3653380	3658180	I mean, I know that there are things nowadays that are science fiction, almost.
3658180	3663780	We were chatting yesterday, just before recording this episode, that we can nowadays control
3663780	3669700	the firing, individual firing in nerve cells of mice or rats, I forget.
3669780	3674900	So the ability to engineer living cells opens up quite a bit of possibilities.
3677060	3677780	Yes, that's right.
3677780	3680580	I mean, one can think of it in different ways.
3680580	3684340	I mean, you can think of agriculture.
3684340	3690020	Of course, genetic engineering methods are well known in agriculture, but also industrial
3690020	3690980	biotechnology.
3690980	3693940	So this is one area that I'm also excited about.
3694260	3704020	You would like to be able to make a new protein, maybe more effectively or cheaply, and you
3704020	3709460	would like to do it in such a way that you can control the different enzymes and the
3709460	3714420	rate of flux at different pathways so that you can get just the optimal amount of protein
3714420	3714980	expression.
3715620	3719700	Now, with cybergenetic techniques using light, we can do this.
3719700	3726180	We have recently demonstrated that we can produce more, have higher yields by simply
3726740	3728020	closing the feedback loop.
3728020	3733380	And in this case, one can measure, for example, the amount of stress a cell has through this
3733380	3739540	fluorescent protein technology that I told you about, and use that information to decide
3739540	3743620	how much expression a particular gene should have, right?
3743620	3748980	So if you have a gene that produces a product of interest, a protein of interest, overexpressing
3748980	3754260	it is not the best way to get more yield because then the cells get stressed and actually
3754260	3755380	your yield goes down.
3756020	3761140	And if you underexpress, again, you're not exploiting the maximum capacity of your cell
3761140	3762740	to produce that protein.
3762740	3766980	There's a sweet spot somewhere in between, and to try to find out where that sweet spot
3766980	3772260	is and to regulate gene expression, because this sweet spot is moving, you regulate the
3772260	3775140	gene expression so you're always tracking that sweet spot.
3775140	3780740	This, I think, is one huge opportunity for cybergenetics in industrial biotechnology.
3781700	3785940	Very often, the impediment is that you have intermediates that are toxic.
3785940	3792580	And so by knowing what the levels of these intermediates are and adjusting variables
3792580	3798500	like gene expression, you can keep the toxicity level to the bare minimum and in the process
3798500	3799860	enhance the yield.
3800580	3803700	So we have in my lab bioreactors or photobioreactors.
3803700	3811140	So these are bioreactors that we have outfitted with LEDs, and we shine the light in feedback
3811140	3812980	to control the entire population.
3812980	3817700	We're not doing single cell control, but we are looking at whole population level control.
3818660	3823700	The other application I'm really excited about for synthetic biology is the therapeutic
3823700	3825540	applications, the medical implications.
3826660	3830340	And that's more long term and more challenging.
3830340	3834980	It takes longer time and also has lots of challenges.
3834980	3839780	I mean, you want to have…anytime you put in a modified cell in a human, you need to
3839780	3841780	get FDA approval.
3841780	3846740	It's a complex and long process, but it's also extremely promising.
3846740	3856580	So one example of this is…so in, I think, 2017 or 2018, FDA approved the use of CAR-T
3856580	3859060	cells for immunotherapy.
3859060	3864100	And this has been one of the most successful treatments for cancer, right?
3864100	3865620	So immunotherapy.
3865620	3872900	So these are cells that are genetically modified to attack cancer cells, and essentially it
3872900	3876900	allows immune response, immune system to target cancer cells.
3876900	3882020	And these cells originate from the patient or from a donor.
3882020	3886340	They're modified in the lab and then put back into the patient's blood so that they
3886340	3887620	can treat diseases.
3888500	3894660	So the problem is that all of these systems, these cell therapies, generally work in an
3894660	3895380	open loop.
3895380	3900900	And so the idea is to actually bring in some of these controllers that we've been developing
3901620	3906660	and have these cells work in a closed loop fashion so that they're sensing the disease
3906660	3914020	state and then producing the amount of therapy, therapeutic, just the right amount to regulate
3914020	3919220	the level of, let's say, a particular biomarker, disease biomarker.
3919220	3923220	And so that's the goal that we have in the lab, and that's what we're working towards.
3923780	3930420	We're making better and better PID controllers or PI controllers, and then adding safety
3930420	3937620	features to them so that they can become, let's say, medical grade so that they have
3937620	3942660	anti-wind-up schemes and, you know, the usual things one has to worry about when implementing
3942660	3945300	integrators in the feedback loop.
3945860	3952740	But really, if you really think about it, most of diseases are essentially due to or
3952740	3956900	can be attributed to feedback loops that have gone awry, right?
3956900	3961300	So, you know, think about cancer, think about diabetes, and so on.
3961940	3966260	Many of the diseases we encounter are essentially due to the…
3967380	3968980	Genetic circuits going astray.
3968980	3971540	Yeah, genetic circuits for various reasons, right?
3971540	3978420	And so, by having the technology to replace these with genetically engineered cells that
3978420	3984180	function as robust control systems, I think we would be able to contribute to disease.
3984180	3987540	At least that's the guiding principle for us and for what we do.
3988420	3990100	And, you know, we will see what happens.
3990100	3991380	This is a long process.
3991380	3996900	It's not something that you can do in the lab today and test it on people the next day.
3996900	4002340	There has to be some different trials, clinical trials, different phases,
4002340	4003780	and it takes years and years.
4004340	4005780	But we have to start somewhere.
4006500	4008260	This is so, so cool.
4009540	4014420	It is science fiction, and I think it's fantastic to watch, you know, from an external perspective.
4014980	4021140	I kind of envision these things as almost like we are building genetic robots, which is
4021940	4022580	incredible.
4022580	4027140	And I guess it also comes with very important ethical challenges.
4027140	4028900	Is this something that you thought about?
4029780	4033540	Yes, I think ethics comes with synthetic biology from day one, right?
4033540	4039460	Anytime you want to modify something genetically, I think one has to think about the consequences.
4040020	4045860	What we do in the lab, you know, these bacteria, they don't survive outside the lab.
4046980	4050180	So whatever modifications we have will have no consequences.
4050180	4056340	However, these days, the tools are available to do much more powerful genetic changes.
4056340	4057620	For example, CRISPR-Cas.
4058180	4065620	I think that this is a new technology that led to a Nobel Prize that allows scientists to
4066260	4070180	modify DNA with precision and efficiency.
4070980	4077060	And this led to a lot of discussions about what one should be able to change or not to change.
4077140	4082180	I mean, the danger, of course, is that you can have these CRISPR babies, as they're called.
4082180	4089780	And there has been already some gross violations by one of the scientists who modified human
4090580	4095780	cells to have, you know, two new babies that have modified DNA.
4095780	4098500	And I think that's very dangerous grounds.
4099300	4105860	There's a fundamental difference between changing, let's say, regular cells and changing,
4105860	4109700	for example, skin cells or liver cells or cancer cells in one patient,
4110500	4116740	and changing cells that propagate, like, for example, sperm cells or egg cells,
4117300	4121940	because the genetic modifications are not restricted to the individual,
4122740	4125380	but they are passed on to their progeny.
4125380	4126900	And that's much, much more dangerous.
4126900	4130740	And I think this is something that we are not ready right now to,
4130740	4133380	or scientists are not ready to go down that path.
4134340	4140500	There are certain other diseases where actually you could do a lot of good by modifying the DNA.
4141220	4146660	Let's say, for example, some patients that have genes that have various mutations that
4147300	4148740	lead to diseases.
4148740	4153540	And so if you can imagine modifying these genes through gene therapy, for example,
4153540	4158580	and reversing or correcting these mutations to restore normal functions,
4158580	4161940	I think that's a very exciting area of gene therapy.
4162740	4167220	But whatever modifications are made are not passed on to the progeny.
4167220	4171380	So I think this is a safer way of doing genetic engineering.
4171380	4173220	They're clearly dangerous, right?
4173220	4180740	So one has to watch out not to make modifications to a cell or, let's say, a bacterium that then
4180740	4184100	becomes more lethal and escapes the lab and so on.
4184100	4189300	And so we have to put in place various measures to ensure that this never happens.
4189300	4194180	And I think ethics goes hand in hand with this business of synthetic biology.
4194180	4199460	Like many other technologies, I think one has to be careful to put in place the right
4199460	4204740	measures to make sure that the chances of accidents like that are basically zero.
4204740	4210820	So with a lot of these, let's say, cell therapies, one hears about what's so-called kill switches.
4211460	4215540	So if you put in the wrong therapy or something happens to the patient that has
4215780	4221780	these genetically engineered cells, there would be the opportunity to kill the cell.
4222500	4227300	So this would be additional circuitry added on top of the genetic circuit to stop everything.
4228100	4233460	And so these are some of the measures people look at for trying to mitigate some of these
4233460	4234340	risks.
4234340	4240500	But at the same time, I mean, if you have a patient that is dying and they have
4240500	4246660	exhausted all other possibilities and there's a new cell therapy available that could give
4246660	4253060	them the chance to live longer or overcome the disease, I think then one has to take
4253060	4256100	that into account as well in making these calculations.
4256900	4260340	Yeah, I guess it's very much context dependent.
4261140	4265300	One thing I wanted to talk about, and then maybe we can move on towards the end of this
4265300	4269140	episode, was a paper that I read from you recently.
4269140	4271460	It's about the internal model principle.
4271460	4276180	I know it has little to do with the applications, but it's something that is very close to my
4276180	4279780	heart, something that I really, really like from classical control theory.
4279780	4283300	And I thought it would be nice to touch on that as well before closing.
4284340	4286180	Yeah, thanks for bringing this up.
4286180	4288740	This is something I've been very excited about recently.
4289780	4294820	So this is a paper, I guess the PNAS paper that you're referring to, appeared two or
4294820	4295540	three months ago.
4296260	4302100	So what this work addresses, and this is, again, I was talking about having to develop
4302100	4306340	a new control theory that's particularly suited for biology, and this is a perfect
4306340	4307220	example of that.
4308100	4312740	I guess as control people, we are taught early on at the graduate level what the internal
4312740	4318020	model principle of Francis and Wanam and, you know, the necessity of certain type of
4318020	4323140	structures, integral feedback, and so on for tracking and rejecting various types of disturbances.
4323940	4328980	These systems, though, that were addressed by this work are mostly linear systems, and
4328980	4331380	they are not positive variables.
4331380	4335860	They are not constrained by chemical reaction constraints.
4335860	4338020	And so in biology, the game is a little bit different.
4338820	4344500	Now, so for this particular work, we started by defining something called robust perfect
4344500	4345220	adaptation.
4345220	4347860	This was available for the literature.
4347860	4350660	We were not the first to introduce it, but it's a useful notion.
4350660	4357620	Essentially, it means tracking and disturbance rejection at the steady state that is robust,
4357620	4358020	right?
4358020	4359380	So robust to what?
4359380	4363220	Robust to parameter changes, robust to topological changes in the network.
4364100	4370580	And we know, for example, in the case of constant in time disturbances and signals, that integral
4370580	4375060	feedback is sufficient for such a robustness, and it's necessary for linear systems.
4375940	4382980	So how would one address this question if the underlying system is a bunch of molecules
4382980	4385300	interacting with each other through chemical reactions?
4385300	4386580	So they're positive variables.
4387620	4391860	And what we were looking at is how do you define robustness in this case?
4391860	4394980	And we looked at the particularly strong notion of robustness.
4394980	4397860	We called it maximal robust perfect adaptation.
4397860	4402820	In other words, the system has to be robust to changes in all the variables, all the parameters,
4402820	4409620	all the reaction rates, except for the ones that determine the set point, like the dial
4409620	4411940	that tunes in what the reference should be, right?
4411940	4413140	You can't be robust to that.
4414020	4414820	Shouldn't be, even.
4415460	4418260	So that's the maximal robust perfect adaptation.
4418260	4419060	That's what it means.
4419060	4426340	So what kind of biological networks allow you to do perfect tracking that is robust
4426340	4428740	to these kind of perturbations?
4429540	4431940	And we managed to obtain an answer.
4432900	4438740	And the answer is different depending on whether this network is deterministic or it has noise.
4438740	4444100	So it's a stochastic network, with the stochastic network's controllers being more stringent.
4444100	4448900	So all of the controllers that work for the stochastic network will work for the deterministic,
4448900	4450020	but not the other way around.
4450020	4455460	There are motifs that will work for the noise-free case, that will not work, will break down
4456100	4457620	in the noisy case.
4458180	4462020	For the noisy case, interestingly, we found that underlying all such motifs,
4462020	4466740	there is the antithetic motif at the heart as the main core component.
4466740	4470900	But more importantly, so we have an algebraic test, a very simple algebraic test.
4470900	4472020	You give me the network.
4472020	4476180	I can apply, look at the certain matrix, and look at those properties.
4476980	4482420	And then from there, I can tell you whether this network has this adaptation property or not.
4483460	4486100	And so that's one of the benefits.
4486100	4492180	And if it does have this property, if it does adapt, I can construct the integrator,
4492180	4494180	which is usually not obvious.
4494180	4498820	Very often, it's a way or a combination of molecules that interact with each other
4498820	4502020	in a certain way to implement this integral feedback.
4502020	4506180	And so this theory allows you to actually find the integrator,
4506180	4508660	which you wouldn't be able to do otherwise.
4508660	4512980	So that's why I think this is kind of nice from a control theoretic point of view.
4513540	4519460	It links in classical notions of internal model principles from Murray and Wanham
4519460	4525220	with sort of modern day biochemical reaction network theory.
4525220	4527140	And we have a nice clean answer.
4527140	4530740	There's still a lot of open problems, but at least for this particular formulation
4530740	4535380	that I just described to you, the answer is clean and it's complete.
4536260	4539940	Oddly enough, I found that this revival of the, let's say,
4539940	4544580	an interest on the internal model principle has appeared in many different branches of
4544580	4545460	control theory.
4545460	4549300	I've seen papers coming from the neuroscience aspects.
4549300	4554820	Of course, many people in the motor control area are also very interested in this concept.
4554820	4560740	And as a groupie, if you want, of this concept myself, I find it very exciting.
4561380	4564340	I think now is really the time to close this episode.
4564340	4566660	It's going to be probably very long.
4566660	4569860	So apologies to the audience, but it was, I hope, very interesting.
4569860	4571620	It was definitely very interesting to me.
4572260	4577060	And as I mentioned also to many other guests of the podcast,
4577060	4580660	I like to ask the question of advice to future students.
4580660	4584900	So people that are interfacing with the idea of continuing in this field
4584900	4589940	or potentially venturing into the synthetic biology or cyber genetics field,
4589940	4591460	what is your best advice?
4591860	4594980	Okay, interesting.
4594980	4597940	So I'm going to give probably a non-traditional advice,
4597940	4600020	but it's one I actually do believe in.
4600020	4607460	And one that I was inspired by a quote from Richard Hamming.
4607460	4610020	I don't know if you know Richard Hamming or not, of course,
4610020	4612100	if you had an electrical engineering background.
4612100	4613700	A stroke of genius.
4613700	4614020	Yeah.
4614020	4615940	And he had the Hamming filter.
4615940	4619700	He had also Hamming windows and Hamming codes and so on.
4619700	4621140	And he worked with Bell Labs.
4621780	4625060	So Richard Hamming was interested in the creative process
4625060	4626260	and how people do research.
4626260	4629300	And he actually wrote several articles on this.
4629300	4632740	And one thing that specifically struck me is the following quote.
4632740	4634580	Let's see if I can remember it.
4634580	4635940	And he says something like this.
4635940	4636260	He says,
4637460	4640660	Most scientists spend almost all of their time
4641540	4646020	working on problems that even they don't consider great,
4646820	4650020	nor do they consider these problems will lead to great work.
4651060	4651700	And so he says,
4651700	4654660	Then if you are working on unimportant problems,
4654660	4657140	you're not going to end up with important work,
4657860	4659860	except by the dumbest of luck.
4660580	4661940	So this may seem trivial,
4661940	4663540	maybe obvious that, of course,
4663540	4665380	if you don't work on important problems,
4666100	4668340	you don't end up doing important work.
4668900	4671540	But I think considering that many people
4672260	4674900	know that the problems they're working on are not important,
4674900	4678740	and I think it behooves us to give this more thought.
4678740	4680580	So if you are starting,
4680580	4684100	if you're a new student that are starting to look for a PhD problem,
4685060	4688500	then I think it is useful to always ask yourself,
4689060	4692100	even though the problem that you're working on seems interesting,
4692100	4693860	and the solution approach is interesting,
4693860	4695060	and the tools are interesting,
4696420	4698980	how relevant would be the solution?
4698980	4700980	If you are to solve what you're trying to solve,
4701540	4702740	what would be the impact?
4703700	4704820	And if it's minimal,
4705620	4710340	maybe it's a chance to look for another problem that has a more impact.
4710980	4713860	And I think really few people think about this.
4714580	4719780	Usually the way you end up working on certain problems by chance,
4719780	4721700	you talk to somebody, or you hear a talk,
4721700	4722020	and you say,
4722020	4723140	Ah, that sounds interesting.
4723140	4724900	I can use this tool or that tool.
4724900	4727620	And you get involved with the problem details,
4727620	4729380	and it's fun and exciting.
4729380	4730660	But at the end of the day,
4731220	4732100	is it relevant?
4732100	4733060	Is it important?
4733060	4737780	And I think it's a good idea to ask oneself every now and then,
4738580	4740340	Am I working on important problems?
4740340	4744020	There are always exciting tools and exciting approaches,
4744020	4745780	no matter what field you work on.
4745780	4751460	So I think simply by addressing this question head on early,
4752180	4754500	I think one could, let's say,
4754500	4757940	have a better chance of having an impact once a solution is obtained.
4758660	4760500	So that's my advice is, you know,
4760500	4763060	ask yourself, is this an important problem?
4763060	4764580	Because if it's not an important problem,
4764580	4767380	it's not likely to lead to important results.
4767380	4770180	I'm not saying it will for sure not lead to important,
4770180	4771540	which sometimes, you know, there is,
4771540	4774580	you might run into something that ends up being important.
4774580	4776820	You didn't intend to solve that problem,
4776820	4779620	but you know, it's just serendipity kicks in, right?
4780500	4784900	Still, I think to the extent that you have an impact on what problems you choose,
4785620	4790820	I think it's a good idea to think about the potential impact of a solution.
